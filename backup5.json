It was followed by a dissemination meeting two days later, also held in Bagamoyo. Why Bagamoyo? IHI, through the project, has worked closely with local communities there to develop a new art-based methodology for accessing the cultural, affective, emotional, faith-based and historical contexts around diabetes and diabetes risk factors that are held in the collective imaginary of a community.\r\nThe Culture and Bodies project team is a partnership of Malawian, Tanzanian and UK researchers and practitioners, spanning the arts and humanities, medical and social sciences, NGOs and local artists, with the aim of creating culturally-situated, art-mediated approaches to non-communicable disease prevention in Malawi and Tanzania. #"

The deal was signed on July 26 in Dar es Salaam and official contract dates are July 2019 to June 2021.\r\nThe signing followed a visit to project sites in Rufiji and Kibiti districts on Thursday July 25 2019 by the Chinese Deputy Minister for Health, Li Bin and NIPD officials who were accompanied by the Minister for Health, Ummy Mwalimu. The China-Tanzania malaria project Principal Investigator, Dr. Prosper Chaki, led the IHI team during the visit.\r\nOn July 27, project partners, including IHI, Bill and Melinda Gates, NIPD, WHO, Harvard, and National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), met at IHI Mikocheni Office, to update themselves on various issues regarding their cooperation.\r\nThe meeting, chaired by Dr. Zhou, discussed challenges encountered during phrase 1 of the project and ways to avoid them during this phase. It also approved the roadmap and protocol for implementation of Phase 2 of the project.\r\nBackground\r\nThe project, which is being implemented in Rufiji, is a collaborative program - part of the China-UK -Tanzania initiative (GHSP-CS-OP4-D02) - that was jointly implemented from April 2015 to June 2018 by the NIPD, IHI and other partners.\r\nThe program\u2019s target was to reduce malaria by 30% by strengthening malaria control capacity at the local level and implementing the Chinese experience in malaria control and elimination in combination with the World Health Organization Test, Treat and Track (T3) strategy.\r\nThrough joint efforts of the Chinese and the Tanzanian teams, a new approach for malaria control in areas of moderate or high transmission was developed, informed by the experience from the Chinese 1-3-7 surveillance and response system for fast tracking malaria elimination.\r\nThe new approach named 1,7-malaria Reactive Community Testing and Response (1.7-mRCT-Response) that utilized evidence from the routine HMIS data and vector surveillance results to decide on the priority clusters (administrative villages/hamlets in Tanzania) to go and conduct community-wide testing and treatment on a weekly basis.\r\nApplication of the novel approach, which had not been used anywhere - neither in China nor in Africa \u2013 showed impressive results by cutting down malaria by up to 81% in intervention areas. During Phase 2 of the project, the team will make additional authentication of the results and estimation of the overall benefits of the intervention in malaria control before scaling up the approach in Tanzania and potentially to other malaria endemic areas in Africa. #"

They are caused by a variety of pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and helminths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is some debate among infectious disease experts over which diseases are classified as neglected tropical diseases. However, these are common of all: ascariasis, Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, dracunculiasis, hookworm infection, human African trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, trachoma, and trichuriasis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#BeatNTDs #WorldNTDDay #IHIimpact #IHIshares #IHIengages</p>"

The private sector is an important and growing provider of healthcare in Tanzania, and has the potential to play a key role in the move to Universal Health Coverage (UHC).&nbsp; UHC requires both improving access to care, and quality of care, but improving quality can be very challenging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Findings were presented from an impact evaluation of the SafeCare Model developed by PharmAccess with the aim of improving quality of care, which was implemented by APHFTA and CSSC in health facilities in Tanzania. The impact evaluation was conducted by IHI, PharmAccess and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evaluation results highlighted that baseline quality was low in all facility types, as measured through compliance with infection prevention and control (IPC), and through treatment of standardized patients. SafeCare was effective at improving structural quality a little, but did not improve clinical quality. Future programmes should consider stronger incentives for quality improvement, greater focus on improving care processes, targeting fewer high-volume facilities, and exploring digital strategies to increase intervention intensity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting ended with the signing of a &ldquo;Quality Improvement Declaration&rdquo; by APHFTA, CSSC and PharmAccess, committing to strengthening quality in Tanzania&rsquo;s health system in terms of safe, effective and patient-centred care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SafeCare evaluation was funded by Health Systems Research Initiative, jointly supported by the UK Medical Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, Department for International Development, the Global Challenges Research Fund, and the Wellcome Trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#IHIresearch #IHIimpact</p>"

Ivermectin will be distributed in mass drug administration campaigns to humans and livestock, for two consecutive years, in order to reduce mosquito populations that transmit malaria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This innovative One Health approach also offers an opportunity for preventing neglected tropical diseases in humans, which will have a positive impact on households. Delivery to livestock reduces the burden of intestinal helminths and ecto-parasites in domesticated herds, thereby increasing income and food security.#</p>"

During the three-month activity, the human and livestock demography will be captured ready for a clinical trial planned for next year. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#212529\">Ivermectin, the drug being investigated, is a medication used to treat many types of parasite infestations and it can be taken by mouth or applied to the skin for external infestations. According to experts, the drug has excellent safety profile that can kill parasites as well as mosquitoes that feed on treated humans or animals. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#212529\">BOHEMIA, whose long form is Broad One Health Endectocide-based Malaria Intervention in Africa, is implemented by a consortium of six partners led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal). Ifakara Health Institute is among the six consortium partners.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#212529\">BOHEMIA Senior Demographer for the Tanzania Site, Siglbert Mrema, said in an interview held recently in Rufiji that the three-month mini-census started in early November 2020 will last until the end of January 2021. &nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#212529\">&ldquo;The min-census will be conducted in 17 wards of the total 29 wards - 7 in Rufiji and 10 in Kibiti. The remaining wards have been excluded from the study due to another malaria intervention ongoing there,&rdquo; he said. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#212529\">Demography, as part of Bohemia work package, will collect information on social economic status, morbidity, mortality in the households, migration and travel patterns, pregnancy status and history of fertility, health system usage, livestock ownership, and malaria risk and prevention, explains Mrema, adding:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#212529\">&ldquo;This information will be used to map mosquito breeding sites and other water borne diseases, creation of clusters for Bohemia intervention, and mapping the study area.&rdquo; All households within Rufiji and Kibiti are eligible for the demographic surveillance if they meet the inclusion criteria. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#212529\">According to Mrema, eligible households are those with at least one inhabitant aged 18 years and above and those particular households must have an identified head of household (available most of the time in that area). &nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#212529\">Apart from Mrema, other members forming the team conducting the mini-census are: Assistant Demographer Deogratius Mujuni, Community Engagement Officer Exavery Chaki, 10 field supervisors, and 73 enumerators. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"color:#212529\">About Bohemia</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#212529\">The BOHEMIA project aims to reduce malaria transmission by administering ivermectin to humans and livestock. This four-year project, funded by Unitaid, conducts two clinical trials in different ecological and epidemiological settings in east and southern Africa, specifically Tanzania and Mozambique. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#212529\">Ivermectin will be distributed in mass drug administration campaigns to humans and livestock, for two consecutive years, in order to reduce mosquito populations that transmit malaria. This innovative One Health approach also offers an opportunity for preventing neglected tropical diseases in humans, which will have a positive impact on households. Delivery to livestock reduces the burden of intestinal helminths and ecto-parasites in domesticated herds, thereby increasing income and food security.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#212529\">BOHEMIA project has brought together six partners forming a consortium led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal).

The project team works closely with regional and district level health officials to effectively plan for, and deliver respectful and skilled reproductive health care, improve the skills of health care workers to effectively manage labour and delivery, and support communities to address local barriers that impede access to health care, especially for women and girls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ifakara Health Institute is an independent evaluator of the program implementation activities. The evaluation goal is to assess if the program has resulted into improved quality and utilization of reproductive, maternal, and new-born health care using a series of cross-sectional households&rsquo; surveys after each round of program implementation activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The baseline data collection was done in 2017. Follow up rounds of data collection were done in 2018 and 2019. The last round of data collection are planned for January and February 2021. #</p>"

The key to reliable, useful diagnosis with an automated microscope lies in computer vision. Simply acquiring digital images and tilling them into a digital smear is an important first step, but robust analysis of the digital images means the technicians don&#39;t need to sift through many images of healthy cells, and instead, they can concentrate their efforts on parts of the image where the algorithm identified suspicious features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once trained, the algorithm will be able to identify many parasites by only asking for the technician opinion in challenging ambiguous cases when it could not identify objects with certainty. Fully automated counts of healthy and infected cells will then allow consistent qualification of test results, informing the clinician prescribing treatment and aiding in disease monitoring. Computer vision is a powerful technique, but it requires high-resolution digital representations of blood smears in order to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project, therefore, has a hardware component, where the research team will build on their earlier work with the open Flexure microscope to create a slide-scanning instrument, capable of digitizing blood smears in the field. This instrument will use low-cost components and desktop digital manufacturing, so that it can be produced locally-freeing clinics from expensive international supply chains, and creating opportunities for local entrepreneurs that build valuable engineering and design skills. This approach has been already tried with the first version of the microscope, which will shortly be available for purchase in Tanzania and Kenya.</p>"

The project is running for four years (2017-2021) In June 2018 the partners conducted their annual meeting in China. Each year the partners will meet in one of the study countries to share the update on the process made, challenges experienced, and ways forward for the research. This year, the meeting was held in two cities in China-Tianjin and Chongqing, hosted by Nankai University, China. From IHI, Ms Gemma Todd (Co investigator) and Ms Irene Moshi (Research Scientist) attended the meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The partners had an opportunity to experience what urban life was like in China, a country with a population of approximately 1. 4 billion and 58% living in urban arears. Compared to Tanzania&rsquo;s population of approximately 55 million by which 33% is urban, the IHI team experienced a great learning curve! Life in China is fast pace, and the scale of development is evident in number of skyscrapers and size of cities. One thing the IHI team noted was the strong amount of state support provided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state provides housing, and mix neighbourhood to try to encourage integration across different income groups. The state also provides service, infrastructure, and the means for citizens to have a good urban life. The states presence in China&rsquo;s urbanization story is complex and there is much to understand, but as we look towards designing and creating sustainable, healthy and learning cities-we at IHI wonder what more can we do in Tanzania.#</p>"

        "description": "<p>This project uses the approach of collaborative quality improvement (QI), which is a bottom-up problem solving method that can be used to strengthen health systems. When applied to maternal and newborn health, it can be used to improve both the quality of and the demand for maternal and newborn health services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To achieve measurable improvements we are integrating the quality improvement strategy at District level health system and regional level. Ultimately, we aim to achieve higher quality of maternal and newborn health care services, better care seeking, and improved maternal and newborn healthcare outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quality improvement teams are formed at the council health management team (CHMT), health facilities and community levels. There are series of learning sessions where teams develop change strategies to address various change topics related to MNH complemented with follow-up mentorship and coaching visits as well as sharing experiences implementing QI in subsequent learning sessions. Run charts are used to track progress throughout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a phased implementation we are targeting Tandahimba and Newala district health facilities followed by Masasi town council and Masasi district council.#</p>\r\n\r\n<p>___________________</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Study Reports and&nbsp; </strong><strong>Other Outputs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Paper accepted and in press</strong>.

The project is conducting an integrated, gender-sensitive, agriculture, nutrition and health intervention with the goal of improving the nutrition and health of children and women in rural Tanzania. The project is addressing child under nutrition by tackling the underlying causes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Agricultural Extension Workers and Community Health Workers have been trained to guide households on best farming practices for the cultivation of nutrient-rich crop varieties and homestead livestock production. The primary targets of the project are women and children in rural households.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We expect that participation in the intervention would lead to increased home food production, improved diets and nutrition of vulnerable household members, improved health behaviors, and empowerment of women. Long-term impacts could include lower levels of childhood infections and mortality, and higher levels of optimal child development. The project will occur in 5 villages under Rufiji DSS.#</p>"

However, currently, we have clearly a lack of understanding of interactions between natural resource extraction projects and health systems, including economic considerations and observed health impacts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#333333\">At the regulatory level, impact assessments are used to identify and mitigate negative externalities. In principle, countries worldwide are legally required to conduct environmental impact assessments (EIA) prior to constructing a large infrastructure project. Yet, despite its universal application, environmental outcomes caused by large infrastructure projects differ widely. As a result, the execution of EIA alone is insufficient to guarantee the minimization of negative environmental externalities. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#333333\">It&#39;s also worth noting that the use of specific health impact assessments (HIA) is less common as no country in Africa actively promotes HIA. Existing evidence on the strengths and limitations of the institutional framework and capacity for impact assessments in general and HIA in particular is scarce in African countries.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#333333\">A better understanding of the links between resource extraction and health impacts on one side and of the framework conditions that determine the effectiveness of health impact assessment on the other, allows for the design of policy measures that can more actively engage natural resource extraction projects in sustainable development.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Objectives</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#333333\">The primary objective of the HIA4SD project is to conduct research that will inform and facilitate a policy dialogue for strengthening the application of impact assessment as a regulatory mechanism to: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#333333\">Avoid negative effects of natural resource extraction projects on public health; </span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#333333\">Actively engage natural resource extraction projects &ndash; and any other large infrastructure developments &ndash; in the SDG 2030 Agenda and, thus, development in Africa.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#333333\">Project Phases</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><span style=\"color:#333333\">Phase I, August 2017 &ndash; July 2020:</span></u><span style=\"color:#333333\"> Aims to generate a sound evidence-base at the national and local levels on the strengths and limitations of current impact assessment practice in engaging natural resource extraction projects to work towards health-related SDG targets. For this purpose, in four African countries, we will: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#333333\">Analyze institutions, policy, regulations and the political economy of the current setup for health in impact assessment; </span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#333333\">Evaluate impact at the national level of past and ongoing natural resource extractive projects on health-related SDG targets; and </span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#333333\">Assess health systems and socioeconomic factors at district level, to determine how natural resource extraction projects interact with and affect local health systems. In the communication and application phase of the project </span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><u><span style=\"color:#333333\">Phase II, August 2020 &ndash; July 2022. </span></u><span style=\"color:#333333\">The research results will then be used to facilitate national and international policy dialogue on how to amend the current governance architecture in a way that makes full use of impact assessments as a regulatory mechanism to support producer regions in working towards the SDG 2030 Agenda.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#333333\">Relevance</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#333333\">The HIA4SD Project seeks to be part of the solution to the global problem of unsustainable extraction of natural resources, which includes adverse impacts on public health, ecosystems and societies in producer regions. The project is expected to strengthen the application of impact assessment as a regulatory mechanism to engage natural resource extraction projects in working towards the SDG 2030 Agenda. This will be achieved through:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#333333\">Negotiations about health impacts of resource extraction that are informed by evidence; </span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#333333\">Increasing awareness among a broad set of stakeholders about the importance of specifically addressing health in impact assessment; and </span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#333333\">Establishing excellence in HIA in the African region.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#333333\">The anticipated impact of the project on public health, health systems, other public services and information flows will benefit poor segments of the population and promote (health) equity in producer regions in Africa. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#333333\">Beneficiaries and Impact</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#333333\">The direct beneficiaries will be the general population and vulnerable people in areas affected by natural resource extraction projects. The impact of the project also extends to the general population in project partner countries through strengthened health systems, cost savings for health systems, additional funds potentially becoming available from natural resource extraction projects for working towards the SDG 2030 Agenda, and more transparency and accountability. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#333333\">Finally, the transnational component of the project might trigger similar processes of transformation in other countries in Africa and beyond, and will thus further expand the radius of potential beneficiaries.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#333333\">Implementation</span></strong><span style=\"color:#333333\"> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#333333\">The project is implemented from September 2017 to August 2022 under the lead of Mirko Winkler, Swiss TPH, together with co-leads from Ifakara Health Institute (Isaac Lyatuu), ETH Zurich (Fritz Brugger), University of Health and Allied Sciences in Ghana (Fred Binka), the Research Institute of Health Sciences in Burkina Faso (Serge Diagbouga), and the Manhi&ccedil;a Health Research Centre in Mozambique (Eus&eacute;bio Macete). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#333333\">The project is funded (CHF 2.7 million) through the Research for Development (r4d) programme (www.r4d.ch), which is a joint funding initiative by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF). #</span></p>"

Technology Gap:</strong> While most women in Africa deliver their babies in health facilities, those facilities do not have the technology necessary to provide comprehensive care for new-born. Solution, Innovative high quality, effective, affordable and sustainable device in partnership with African clinicians and engineers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Human Resources Gap:</strong> There is fundamental shortage both clinicians and maintenance technician who are trained to support the implementation of comprehensive new born care. Solution: Educate, in partnership with local training institutions, clinicians, technicians, and biomedical innovation to use and sustainable these tools and to create the next generation of technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Implementation Gap:</strong> Health system managers do not have adequate means to introduce, scale and sustain quality comprehensive care program, including the ability to monitor health outcomes and policy effects. Solution: Develop and optimize a NEST Planning and implementation Guide and a Financing Metric Toolkit to support with the data the need for, and efficacy of, comprehensive new born care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Market Gap:</strong> The uncertain market size and high cost of distribution in Africa and significance barriers that have proven difficult for manufactures to overcome. Solution: Shape a functioning market by launching a new company to aggregate demand, negotiate bulk discounts with suppliers and coordinate network of local distribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Objectives and Specific Aims</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To address these barriers we aim to deploy NEST: a bundle of New-born Essential Solutions and Technologies designed to prevent and treat the leading causes of new born deaths in Africa. NEST technologies are designed in partnership with African hospital to be effective, affordable and rugged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NEST will allow clinicians to provide high quality comprehensive new born care keeping babies warm, helping them breathe, diagnosing infections, treating jaundice and other life threatening conditions for small and sick babies. Through in-service training and mentoring programs, NEST will build clinical and technical capacity to improve new borne care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will partner with local universities and colleges to educate a pipeline of future clinicians, technicians, and innovators dedicated to improving new born health. NEST will develop tools to help district health manager&rsquo;s plan and implement comprehensive new born care programs and to track health outcomes that ensure quality and help secure resources to scale high quality programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we will work with governments and the private sector to generate large-scale demand for and sustainable supply of these lifesaving technologies for comprehensive new born care. #</p>"

Ultrasound might therefore increase the proportion of correctly managed patients (i.e patients who have TB receive anti TB treatment, whereas patients will be higher in the intervention group than in the control group (85% vs 73%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The objective of thios study is to assess the impact of Sonography on the proportion of correctly managed patients with the suspected EPTB and morbidity and mortality in a a randomized control trial in 2 centers (St Francis Referral Hospital, IHI Ifakara, TB Clinic , Mwananyamala Hospital). Patients will be managed according a predefined algorithm including Sonography in the intervention arm and according state of the art in the control group.#</p>"

The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, caused by Ebola Zaire strain, gained widespread attention as it took a different pattern and has reached historic proportions, characterized by a rapid and larger spread beyond Africa, and a greater magnitude than all the other outbreaks combined, underscoring its serious threat to the public health. No vaccines or antiviral drugs currently approved for prevention or treatment of Ebola infections in humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the severity of the recent Ebola outbreak and the potential risk of global spread, has spurred research for the rapid development of safe and effective preventive Ebola vaccine. Such a vaccine, that can rapidly induce strong and long-lasting protective immune responses against all main Ebola strains and that can be readily produce and deployed in the field, is needed to protect people in endemic regions in an event of an outbreak but also to protect healthcare workers caring for Ebola patients who are at the highest risk of infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The objective of the PEVIA project is the development of a new 2nd generation of preventive pan-Ebola vaccine based on two complementary and synergistic vaccine approaches:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A&nbsp; recombinant native Ebola GP-based vaccine, and a long synthetic peptides (LSP)-based vaccine containing multiple overlapping CD4+and CD8+T-cell epitopes derived from the Ebola GP and nucleoprotein (NP) and highly conserved between all main Ebola strains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prime-boost combination of these two vaccines will offer safe, strong, specific, efficient, high quality and long-lasting B and T-cell immune protection against major strains of Ebola virus, both identified as fundamental to protect against the EBOV.#</p>"

Moreover, helmith infectious can be a negative impact on children&rsquo;s nutritional status. Additionally, new research has revealed increasing under nutrition as risk factors. Consequently, children are at increased risk of compromised health due to dual burden of disease, which may hamper their development and wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dual burden constitutes a challenge for health systems in African countries. Although children are mainly affected by infectious diseases, they may at young age already develop risk factors predisposing them to NCDs in early adulthood.

In this project, we are exploiting this mosquito behaviour and use footwear as a platform to release highly effective wide-area spatial mosquito repellents, creating full-time protection against both day-biting and night-biting mosquitoes at individual and household level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day-biting Aedes mosquitoes, which transmit most of the arboviral infections that the world is least prepared to combat, i.e. Zika, Dengue, Yellow fever and Chikungunya, are largely non-responsive to LLINs and IRS. Moreover, no vaccines and no reliable diagnostics for field use are available for many of these arboviruses, and therefore mosquito control remains the main intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, the aquatic habitats of these mosquitoes are often small, scattered, cryptic, temporary and sometimes indoors, hence difficulty of larval source management. Though already widely prevalent in the Americas and the pacific, the threat of outbreaks of these mosquito-borne infections including Zika outbreaks in Africa is increasingly realistic, given the large volume of intercontinental travel (e.g. the forthcoming Olympic games), the large endemic populations of known vectors, evidence of endemic and geographically diversifying Zika virus in multiple African countries, e.g. Uganda, Gabon, Nigeria and Senegal. Together, mosquito-borne infections are among the most costly, significantly burdening low-income countries. For example global Dengue fever epidemics cost ~8 billion dollars annually, while malaria budgetary needs are consistently above 5 billion dollars annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Effective and low-cost tools are therefore urgently needed to proactively prevent outbreaks and control infections. For maximum benefits, scalability and user-acceptability, such new approaches should be integrated against all or most mosquito-borne infections, and should be possible to implement alongside existing measures. The project is designed to create low-cost repellent-treated sandals that provide round-the-clock protection against Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya and Malaria.#</p>"

EN-BIRTH is an observational study of 20,000 births in five facilities in Tanzania, Bangaladesh and Nepal, between mid- 2017 and mid-2018. We propose to add developmental follow-up a cohort of newborns identified through EN-BIRTH, who have been exposed to basic newborn interventions at participating health facilities in Tanzania, Bangaladesh and Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This add-on cohort study will be called EN-SMILING, following these children to the age of 5 years to extend the current research on simplified metrics from the time of birth to include metrics for child development, and to promote early identification of adverse developmental outcomes after exposure to basic newborn interventions, including newborn resuscitation, KMC and treatment for presumed bacterial infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The link between newborn health and early child development (ECD) is crucial. Birth is a time of great risk and opportunity for death, disability and child development. Nearly 10% Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) globally are due to newborn death and impartment after newborn complications. Less is known about developmental consequences for newborns who had basic interventions, such as basic resuscitation, kangaroo mother care (KMC) and inpatient treatment for presumed neonatal infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early Child development (ECD) is central to the SDGs, linking health (SGD3), educational attainment (SDG4), economic growth (SDG 8) and inequality reduction (SGD 10). Impaired ECD reflects inequalities between and within countries and keep nations in poverty. Prevention of impairment, early detection and intervention for developmental delays can transform individual and population potential. If routine measurement were simplified and integrated with newborn and child health care, this could lead to earlier intervention and improve school readiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study objectives build on EN-BIRTH objectives as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Measure:</strong> Develop and test a structured approach to child development measurement (simple tools, timing, training) and evaluate accuracy compared to &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; developmental assessment as well feasibility and acceptability for health workers and families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Detect:</strong> Assess prevalence of developmental delay from birth to 5 years for a sub-sample of newborns across all three study sites who required basic newborn interventions, compared to randomly selected, matched newborns, not exposed to basic interventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Integrate Metrics and Care:</strong> Expore challenges and enablers for routine use of the simplified, structured early child developmental delays or disability in these three countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Infants recruited from EN-BIRTH will be followed up from birth until 5 years of age. Using a simplified ECD measurement approach, they will be assessed at 6,9,12,18,24,36 and 60 months. Through comparison with &lsquo;gold standard&rsquo; comprehensive child development assessments (i.e. Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition (Bayley III) at 3 years and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) at 5 years performance of the simplified ECD measurement approach will be evaluated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mixed method assessment of feasibility and acceptability will inform the possibility of use at scale. This research will inform ECD measurement integration within newborn and child health (such as immunisation appointments), improve understanding of child development impact of basic newborn interventions and inform approaches to improving access to and design of early intervention for those at risk of adverse developmental outcomes.</p>"

Specific Aims 1. What are the different types of corruption in the health sector, what are the conditions that incentivise corrupt behaviour in health workers, and what is the impact on patients? [methods: literature review, policy analysis, qualitative studies]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. How do the existing legal and regulatory frameworks and supervision practises promote or constrain corrupt practices b providers? [methods: literature review, policy analysis, qualitative study] 3.

Specific aims 1. How is membership decided for the study interventions: health facility committees (Nigeria, Tanzania), facility score cards (Tanzania), public hearings (Bangladesh)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. To what extent do different social accountability mechanisms achieve representation (descriptive and substantive) of the diverse groups in communities? 3.

Are any of these approaches perceived to have led to improvements in access to drugs, medicines and services? If so, how? 5. What roles do factors such as trust, distribution of power, and formal and informal relationships play in determining a) membership of these mechanisms and b) their effectiveness?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. What interventions (e.g legal requirements on membership; formal regulation and sanctions) could improve the representation of members? 7.

However, in south-eastern Tanzania, pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles Funestus (mediating &gt;80% of transmission,) and outdoor-biting Anopheles arabiensis, are compromising the gains. The situation is worse for low income families, who despite improvements of livelihoods across Tanzania, and many low-income households, still live in poorly-constructed houses with gaps on eaves, doors and windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To achieve the 2020 national target of 2% prevalence, and thereafter elimination, Tanzania urgently needs complementary tools. House-screening can reduce indoor-biting and malaria burden, but is hardly scaled-up because available epidemiological evidence is considered inadequate; and diverted mosquitoes can bite others. Besides, full house-screening (of windows, eaves and doors) is impractical where rural households keep doors open in evenings. Introducing effective mosquito trapping in these settings could potentially increase households-level and communal-level protection even for non-users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, odour-baited traps targeting An. funestus previously reduced malaria prevalence by 28.9% in western Kenya. The study intends to demonstrate that combining house-screening and odour baited traps can significantly improve protection in rural Tanzania communities dominated by An funestus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study will first optimize the intervention package inside semi-field cages against laboratory reared mosquitoes then evaluate it ij field settings. This approach will provide complementary, eco-friendly and non-insecticidal options for low incomes families</p>"

        "description": "<p>Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) has revolutionized the development of malaria vaccines. The procedure involves administration of known numbers of sporozoites or infected erythrocytes to healthy human volunteers under controlled environment. Use of highly sensitive molecular malaria diagnostic methods informs treatment decisions before symptoms develop, and allow characterization of parasite growth dynamics. Sporozoite CHMI has safely been used in six countries in Africa providing a platform to assess the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates, and study the natural immunity to malaria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blood stage CHMI involves administration of known number of chloroquine sensitive infected erythrocytes in healthy volunteers, and it is a more sensitive model for modelling parasite growths and study the efficacy of blood-stage malaria vaccines. It has been safely used in Australia and Europe but not in Africa. Adaptation of this model by administration of combination of suboptimal and optimal antimalarial drugs lead to increased gametocytemia, and infection rates in mosquitoes following standard membrane feeding assay. Such adaptation allows the model to be used to study parasite transmission from human to mosquitoes, and evaluate transmission blocking malaria interventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish an in vivo model for early-stage clinical evaluation of transmission blocking interventions (TBI) in volunteers living in malaria endemic countries. This would allow rapid and cost-effective way to down-select candidate malaria vaccine and drugs before larger, more complex and expensive field efficacy studies are conducted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project intends to use an ideal dose of chloroquine-sensitive infected erythrocytes to establish an in vivo transmission model for studying TBI. Specifically, the project is designed to achieve the following:<br />\r\n<strong>1.</strong> Assess the efficiency of two antimalarial drugs regimens (Sulfadoxinepyrimethamine and doxycycline) to induce high levels of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gametocytemia and mosquito infection rates in healthy African adults.<br />\r\n<strong>2.</strong> Investigate the determinants of successful transmission to mosquitoes including underlying immune responses to both asexual and sexual malaria antigens, asexual parasite dynamics and gametocyte burden, sex ratio of male and female gametocytes, and the relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection rate.<br />\r\n<strong>3. </strong>Establish a PhD studentship in malaria immunoepidemiology to undertake the studies described in this project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, additional funding will be sought to test the utility of this model for evaluating the in vivo gametocytocidal activity of a candidate transmission blocking vaccine as a proof of concept in a small phase Ib trial in healthy African adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project is part of the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trial Partnership (EDCTP2) program supported by the European Union (EU).</p>"

        "description": "<p><a name=\"_Hlk67482088\"><strong>Introduction</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TB-CAPT (Close the gap, increase Access, provide adequate Therapy) project will provide evidence for impactful implementation of tuberculosis (TB) and TB/HIV co-infection diagnostic strategies including drug-susceptibility testing through a series of trials in Tanzania, Mozambique, and South Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TB-CAPT is funded by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) and will run for 3.5 years, with the planned completion in 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is estimated that each year more than 10 million people worldwide fall ill with tuberculosis (TB). However, currently, only around 7 million of them are identified &ndash; while the others are missed. Of the nearly 2 million deaths each year most are preventable with existing treatments, if diagnosed early, but diagnostic gaps in TB remain greater than for any other infectious disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an urgent need for TB tools and diagnostic technologies that can not only detect disease but can also identify strains that are resistant to the TB medications that are available. Containing the emergence of TB drug resistance is critical if we are to have a chance to beat the disease while the medicines that we have still work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The introduction of automated real-time PCR-based technologies (i.e., GeneXpert&reg;) improved TB case-detection and reduced diagnostic delay. Many studies conducted since then have contributed to both an understanding of the test&rsquo;s limitations and the need for better tests to achieve the post-2015 TB targets of the World Health Organization (WHO). Even more importantly, the studies highlighted the need for optimized implementation strategies for novel tests and improved linkage to treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next-generation tests need to be placed at the point-of-care at microscopy centre level, fully integrated in the diagnostic and treatment network, connectivity enabled, more sensitive and able to perform expanded drug susceptibility testing (DST). Additionally, people living with HIV (PLHIV) are not well served by sputum-based diagnostics and non-traditional specimen-types (such as urine, oral swabs, and stool) and test technologies (such as the FujiLAM assay) have shown promise to improve diagnosis in this population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Approach</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TB-CAPT includes a series of clinical trials in Tanzania, Mozambique, and South Africa that will evaluate the impact of diagnostic interventions on outcomes, including the effects of expanding TB testing strategies to PLHIV. The trials have been designed to consider local epidemiology, as well as existing infrastructure, and will compare new strategies with current standards of care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Specific objectives, aims, and activities to help achieve the overarching goal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>To evaluate the most promising new technologies in settings of intended use.The GeneXpert Omni instrument with the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra cartridge meet the high-priority target product profile (TPP) and thus have the potential to improve patient outcomes when replacing the current standard of care (sputum-smear testing or centralised testing). We have identified the following key TB diagnostic trials which are needed to inform policy development and country scale-up, and which we will implement in TB-CAPT:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial (&mdash;&gt; our CORE trial) that assesses the impact of the implementation of Omni (with the Ultra assay) in settings of intended use.</li>\r\n\t<li>Enabling of culture-free diagnosis for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB through the implementation of the XDR cartridge (&mdash;&gt; our XDR trial), and assess the impact</li>\r\n\t<li>Assess expanded testing strategies for the most vulnerable patients with HIV (&mdash;&gt; our HIV trial) infection through testing unselected hospitalized PLHIV with Ultra on multiple available samples (sputum, urine, stool) and FujiLAM on urine.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n\t<li>Facilitate policy change and inform implementation strategies at global, national, and regional level: TB-CAPT will inform WHO recommendations on the implementation of the first diagnostic platform suitable to replace smear-microscopy at the most peripheral level of healthcare. Within our trial countries Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania, we will work with national programmes, governments, and local implementers to generate data to support the development and execution of implementation plans. In addition, FIND and the African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) will assist in translating findings to aid scale-up also beyond trial countries. To achieve this, TB-CAPT will specifically:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Join forces with other global trial sites to ensure global representativeness of the combined data</li>\r\n\t<li>Use transmission and socio-economic modelling to provide the health care system with predictions of impact and cost of implementation on population level.</li>\r\n\t<li>Ensure early and ongoing engagement with national TB programmes in early adopter countries, with ASLM and the WHO.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n\t<li>Strengthen in-country infrastructure and human capacity: TB-CAPT will work with renowned institutions in our trial countries (Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania), local researchers, and government infrastructure, to develop enhanced capacity for conducting clinical trials, implementation research and implementation plans for new diagnostics. Specifically, we will:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Build capacity within our partner institutions for a series of implementation trials of novel diagnostic tests to follow the TB-CAPT project.</li>\r\n\t<li>Develop capacity to diagnose and treat DR-TB at level 1 settings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about this project visit the <a href=\"https://www.tb-capt.org/\">TB-CAPT consortium website.</a></p>"

The study, which falls in the social determinants and health system efficiency research category, was conducted for 9 months from November 2017 to April 2018 &ndash; by four researchers: Ms. Shabani, Ms. Gemma Todd, the late Dr. Godfrey Mbaruku (all from IHI) and Dr. Anna Nswilla from PO-RALG).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers used the 2015/16 Tanzania Demographic Health Survey (TDHS) and the 2012 National Census to provide an overview of maternal mortalities. The research was conducted with funding from the Internal Center for Growth (IGC) in response to the fact that maternal mortality rates in Tanzania had remained stubbornly high over the last decade, at around 500 per 100,000 live births, despite interventions. It sought to analyze the entire chain &ndash; from the time mothers seeking care to delivery &ndash; with a view to understand where bottlenecks and delays occurred as well as their causes. #</p>"

Apart from Unisant&eacute;, IHI and NIMR, other research centers taking part in the study are: &Eacute;cole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the Swiss TPH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study, which is implemented in Tanzania and Switzerland through a joint project named &lsquo;Dynamic, was officially launched last week and is planned to last five years. The initiative is poised to avoid millions of clinical failures and tens of millions of unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics every year, in Africa and perhaps one day in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The algorithm the scientists are studying will be used to develop new mobile tools that will improve the identification of children suffering from a serious illness requiring immediate treatment, and therefore reducing mortality. Through the project, electronic diagnostic and treatment tools will be deployed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers in the project are optimistic that the outcome of the study will be effective tools that help clinicians to manage febrile children more effectively. What we already know about febrile children Each year, around 3.3 million children die from acute febrile episodes worldwide, especially in countries with low-resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lack of diagnostic tools and clinical guidance to front-line health workers strongly contribute to this situation, and leads at the same time to unnecessary antimicrobials prescribed to &ldquo;be on the safe side&rdquo;. Around nine in every ten children attending primary health care establishments in Tanzania receive an antibiotic, although only one in ten really need it. This over-prescription is a major factor in antibiotic resistance, which is one of the world&rsquo;s most serious health problems and a major healthcare challenge. Moreover, when an epidemic breaks out, young children are the first victims of resistant infections which can no longer be tackled using first line antibiotics and contribute in turn to this high mortality.</p>"

The prize worth Euros 500,000, equivalent to TZS 1.27 billion, will run for 4 years beginning January 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IHI Director of Science, Dr. Fredros Okumu, said on a Sunday evening email to all IHI staff: &ldquo;Ally will use the [fellowship] financing to adapt the now successful controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) platform in Bagamoyo to support pathogen transmission studies here in Tanzania.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking over the phone from Bagamoyo after the news broke, Dr. Olotu expressed optimism that the fellowship will provide an opportunity for mentoring of young researchers in Africa. &ldquo;This will be a great opportunity for me to advance my mentorship skills,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Olotu, who is based at the IHI Clinical Trials Facility in Bagamoyo added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting that scientifically, I will be among a few researchers in Africa applying the adapted state-of-the-art CHMI model and contribute to new knowledge as we try to study and understand more [malaria] transmission processes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vast majority of IHI staff, sent congratulatory messages to Dr. Olotu on winning the fellowship. Of all Dr. Rashid Ally Khatib&rsquo;s was a beauty: &ldquo;I am very much encouraged by your hard work&hellip; It is not easy nowadays to win the grant of that size in malaria studies. I am sure that EDCTP has funded your idea because they trust you and the Institute that you are in a position to translate this grant into an opportunity to get Tanzania and beyond to the last mile in malaria control.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About EDCTP program</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EDCTP program develops a pool of highly qualified senior researchers in the field of poverty related diseases (PRDs) in sub-Saharan Africa. It ensures there is continued support for the development and retention of senior fellows in the region. The program believes, this in turn will ensure supportive mentorship structure, sustainable research capacity and provide a career pathway for researchers in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senior EDCTP Fellowship primary purpose is to support capacity development of potential sub-Saharan African research leaders to become long-term trainer of trainers and mentors for junior researchers with emphasis on hands-on research training linked to clinical trials activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, the fellowship seeks to support senior researchers to advance their career as world class research leaders in product development through clinical trials and closely related fields; and to equip them with skills to train and mentor junior researchers at host institutions in sub-Saharan Africa. #</p>"

        "description": "<p>The world&#39;s attention has been focused on COVID-19, but the World Health Organization [WHO] needs to take urgent action to accelerate the market entry of next-generation insecticide-treated nets, warns Professor Gerry Killeen, the newly appointed AXA Chair in University College Cork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Killeen&rsquo;s warning has been published on April 16 this week in the prestigious Lancet medical journal in his paper bearing the title, <span style=\"color:#00b050\"><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930745-5\" style=\"color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:#00b050\">&ldquo;Control of malaria vectors and management of insecticide resistance through universal coverage with next-generation insecticide-treated nets.&rdquo;</span></a></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof Killeen, an expert on disease control has received an AXA Research Chair award to UCC worth &euro;1m to bring the fight against malaria one step closer to eradication, while, at the same time, fostering improved management of wildlife areas in Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malaria still infects hundreds of millions of people each year, transmitted through the bites of mosquitoes. Currently, the most effective way to prevent it is with insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) placed over all beds and other sleeping spaces, to not only protect the human users but also kill mosquitoes attempting to attack them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While increasingly widespread use of ITNs has achieved great reductions of malaria burden since the turn of the century, a recent WHO report has found the fight against this mosquito-borne disease stalled from 2014 onwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Since the turn of the century, over 4 million malaria-related deaths have been averted in Africa, mostly through vector control using bed nets treated with exceptionally safe and affordable pyrethroid insecticides,&rdquo; said Prof Killeen, an applied pathogen ecologist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;However, progress has stalled for two major reasons: because resistance of mosquitoes to insecticides has eroded the impact of insecticide-treated nets, and because mosquitoes can avoid them by feeding upon animals, feeding outdoors or resting outdoors.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As explained by Prof Killeen in the Lancet today, a novel range of new ITN products, treated with two or more complementary insecticides from different chemical classes, offer exciting options for tackling insecticide resistant malaria mosquitoes now and in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a delay in approving these next-generation ITNs could cost lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Urgent corrective action is required to reform global policy regarding where, when and how new insecticides and new next generation ITNs are used,&rdquo; Prof Killeen warns in the Lancet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Literally millions of lives will depend on whether we decide to use emerging new next generation ITN technologies for pre-emptive insecticide resistance management now, or in a biologically unsustainable reactive fashion later,&rdquo; he writes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His AXA-funded research at UCC will recognize the fact that not all mosquitos act the same, and can adapt to their environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not only can next-generation ITNs be used reactively now to kill the insecticide resistant mosquitoes we face to today, they can also be used to prevent mosquitoes with further forms of resistance against new insecticides from evolving over the decades ahead,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Some feed on humans outdoors, while others exploit cattle or their wild relatives as alternative sources of blood, thereby evading interventions targeted to humans or livestock. These behaviours may make it particularly difficult to eliminate malaria from many parts of Africa where humans and wildlife co-exist&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof Killeen is leading a research program to characterize the opportunities and obstacles that arise notably from biodiversity conservation efforts in Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through ground-breaking research, he aims to prove that malaria elimination will require interventions that target all the different blood-feeding behaviors mosquitoes can exhibit, including feeding upon wild animals, and that an opportunity may exist to preserve and restore insecticide susceptibility in vector populations if they can be found persisting in conversation areas where pesticides are absent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof Killeen is particularly interested in Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) in Tanzania, where he has been based at the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) for the last 17 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;These transitional conservation areas are grossly understudied and their potential is far from fully exploited. Simply by doing research there, we hope to both enhance the protection and utility of these areas, while also protecting humans from the pathogens and vectors that live there. The project relates primarily to health, but it also pertains substantially to biodiversity and the environment&rdquo;, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By committing to share two thirds of the funds provided by AXA with IHI and a local WMA in Tanzania and supplementing that with postgraduate degree scholarships for local scientists, UCC is investing in strengthening resilience of the country at institutional level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One reviewer of Prof Killeen&rsquo;s application to the AXA Research Fund described UCC as &ldquo;an outward-looking institution with a broad, interdisciplinary research interest&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I could not have asked for greater commitment by UCC to the principles of benefit sharing with partner institutions in low and middle-income countries,&rdquo; Prof Killeen said. #</p>"

Now it is strongly recommended for all adults with signs and symptoms of TB regardless of HIV or MDR status&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A set of recommendations under Section 1 of the guideline, headlined &ldquo;Molecular assays intended as initial tests for TB,&rsquo; provide for application of two novel technologies: Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as initial tests in adults and children with signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB. IHI work contributed in the review and adoption of the first one: Xpert MTB/RIF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their review Haraka and his team had shown those patients who were diagnosed using Xpert MTB/RIF had better chances of surviving and being cured compared to those diagnosed using the standard of care, smear microscopy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recommendation reads: &ldquo;In adults with signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB, Xpert MTB/RIF should be used as an initial diagnostic test for TB and rifampicin-resistance detection in sputum rather than smear microscopy/culture and phenotypic DST. <em>(Strong recommendation, high certainty of evidence for test accuracy; moderate certainty of evidence for patient-important outcomes)</em>&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does this mean? Dr. Haraka says, the new guidelines when adopted by national TB programs, will be applied by health care personnel to improve TB diagnostics. &ldquo;The new recommendation means better access for TB diagnostic for all&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Commenting on his involvement and participation in the review of the testing technology along with top scientists from around the world, Dr. Haraka says, &ldquo;It was a great learning opportunity on how WHO guideline development process occurs. We are happy to have been part of this great global effort and to learn that our ten years of TB research at our Institute gets global recognition in some way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Ally Olotu, Head of the Interventions and Clinical Trials department at IHI, who is Frederick&rsquo;s peer, says, &ldquo;It is indeed fulfilling to see your work is being recognized and considered in the development of the international guidelines. Congratulations to the entire TB research team!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below are some of the quick reactions to the news:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Great milestone!&rdquo; Dr. Robert Ndege, Head of IHI&rsquo;s Chronic Diseases Clinic in Ifakara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We appreciate the effort made to contribute to the global recommendations,&rdquo; Dr. Ester Elisaria, senior researcher at IHI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Great achievement!&rdquo; Dr. Maja Weisser, an international public health researcher with IHI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The political declaration at the first United Nations (UN) high-level meeting on TB held on September 26th, 2018 included commitments by Member States to diagnose and treat 40 million people with TB in the 5-year period 2018&ndash;2022. The approximate breakdown of the target is about 7 million in 2018 and about 8 million in subsequent years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traditional method for diagnosing TB using a light microscope, developed more than 100 years ago, has in recent years been challenged by several new methods and tools. These methods are based on either the detection of mycobacterial antigens or on the detection of mycobacterial DNA. The novel tools to detect presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and resistance to anti-TB drugs called for evidence-based policy recommendations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WHO published a number of guidelines developed by WHO-convened Guideline Development Groups (GDGs), using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to summarize the evidence and to formulate policy recommendations and accompanying remarks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the growing number of published guidelines complicates the overview of recommendations for the intended audience (which includes health care personnel, national TB programs and policymakers), and WHO recognized the need to consolidate the recommendations into one document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recommendations in the new document, one of them being that on the use of &lsquo;Xpert MTB/RIF&rsquo; tool which IHI contributed in reviewing, have been presented in five guidelines published by WHO between 2016 and 2020. Earlier guidelines on diagnostics that were not developed according to the GRADE approach have not been included in the <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1284627/retrieve\" style=\"color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:#00b050\">consolidated document.</span></a> #</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#00b050\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/KSqvAi1ZENg\" style=\"color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:#00b050\">Watch video here.</span></a></span> View event photos here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#ifakarascience #TBresearch #ifakaramilestone</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ifakara Health Institute has trained five laboratory technologists from Zanzibar in Molecular Viral Diagnostics. Ifakara lab experts, led by Bagamoyo Lab Manager, Sarah Mswata, conducted the training in Bagamoyo, Tanzania recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other trainers were: Solomon Mwakasungula, Happy Mkali, Zena Emmanuel, Grace Mwangoka, Mohammed Sasamalo, Alwissa Urassa (all from Ifakara), and Tobias Schindlier (from the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute - SwissTPH).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ifakara partnered with the Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA) of Tanzania through the support of USAID PREDICT project in Tanzania to deliver the eleven-day training held at the Ifakara Health Institute&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://ihi.or.tz/our-infrastructure/\">Bagamoyo Laboratory</a> from July 13 &ndash; 17, 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USAID PREDICT project in Tanzania has worked to put One Health in action and strengthen national capacity for infectious disease prevention, surveillance, and detection since 2009. The project is based at Ifakara Health Institute and Sokoine University of Agriculture (with support from the University of California, Davis &ndash; PREDICT&rsquo;s lead implementing partner).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the multidisciplinary, one health approach; USAID PREDICT project conducted surveillance at the human-wildlife interface to detect and characterize new and known viruses of epidemic and pandemic potential in high-risk communities and clinics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the built capacity on detection of known and novel viruses and capacity to carry out testing of the current pandemic of COVID-19; The laboratory team has prepared a training program to build capacity for the lab professionals (public health for Cohort 1) to support government effort in strengthening the detection and surveillance capabilities across both sectors, and contribute data for surveillance reporting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why this training now?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Mswata notes that the primary objective of the training was strengthening the Zanzibar laboratory capacity in molecular viral diagnostics. According to her, between April and May 2020, laboratory scientists from Ifakara Health Institute went to Zanzibar to assess the risk and capacity of diagnosing COVID-19 in Zanzibar laboratories. The assessment was made as part of support in fighting pandemics such as COVID19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In addressing some of the found challenges, the IHI lab team organized a training as a continuation of support to Zanzibar laboratories capacity building in diagnosis of viral diseases, including COVID 19 molecular diagnostics tests. The training also covered the capacity to diagnose other emerging and re-emerging viral infections of pandemic potential,&rdquo; she explains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Training participants from the two major Islands of Unguja and Pemba, &ldquo;had a background on molecular biology and were laboratory personnel from the Mnazi Mmoja Hospital in Unguja and Public Health Laboratory in Pemba. The two laboratories had previously been assessed by IHI lab technologists for their capacity to conduct molecular testing, including highly infectious virus such as the SARS COV 2 virus.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More: About the training</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The training topics, for theory, included: biosafety and biosecurity; refresher training on basics of molecular biology; epidemiology of COVID 19 and diagnostics methods; sample management &amp; cold chain storage; and introduction to One health Approach and Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For practice, they covered: diagnosis of COVID19 using RT-qPCR method based on the 2 WHO recommended protocols: the Berlin protocol which and the Allplex Seegene kit protocol which the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) has procured through IHI to support the in-country testing capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The team showed high level of dedication and eagerness to learn these techniques practically as they had no prior hands on experience to the techniques,&rdquo; acknowledges Ms. Mswata, adding:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The trainees had the opportunity to learn other methods of detection of emerging &amp; re-emergenging viruses using the PREDICT protocols&hellip; Also, the trainees got the opportunity to learn on the protocol for detection of Human Ribonuclease P (RNaseP) which is abundant in human cells as internal control for extraction and qPCR.&rdquo; #</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more photos: <a href=\"https://ifakarahealthinstitute.smugmug.com/TRAINING-Ifakara-builds-Zanzibar-lab-capacity/\">Visit our gallery here.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>#ifakaratraining #ifakaraimpact #ifakarasupport</p>"

        "description": "<p>Bed nets with more robust fabrics used for malaria control have a longer life-span, and could save nearly 20% of costs associated with purchasing a bed net each year, a study conducted by Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) and partners has found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) are the most widely adopted preventive measure against malaria, and represent an effective form of prevention for at-risk populations. ITNs work by both preventing bites and killing mosquitoes that are searching for humans at night. ITNs, and in particular long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), represent a cost-effective means of malaria prevention for at-risk populations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study, dubbed &ldquo;ABCDR Project,&rdquo; evaluated the useful life of three different LLINs over three years (2013-2016) in Tanzania and determined that the bed nets with more durable fabrics had a longer life-span and could result in nearly 20% reduction of costs per year of the effective life of a bed net.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Group leader of the study, Dr. Sarah Moore, comments that if global procurement agencies choose more durable bed nets, it would result in fewer purchased nets and higher LLIN coverage. This would ultimately result in more sustainable malaria interventions, both physically and economically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;More than 2 billion ITNs have been procured for public health. They are an incredibly important aspect of malaria control that have saved millions of lives. However, it is the user of the net that ultimately decides its effective life. When ITNs get damaged through wear and tear people throw them away, even when they are still insecticidal,&quot; Dr. Moore told the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) &ndash; one of the key IHI partners in the study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to her, as over one billion bed nets were delivered globally between 2012-2017, the measurement and reporting of the functional life of new ITNs on the market is a vital component of product evaluation. Previous research from the Health Interventions Unit at Swiss TPH showed that by increasing the life of bed nets, the number of nets needed to reach coverage targets could be reduced by up to 60%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The data we have collected can support policy makers and vector control specialists both in Tanzania and the Sub Saharan African region to maximize current gains in malaria control,&quot; said Dr. Moore. &quot;New ITNs are being developed with brand new chemistries to combat insecticide resistance. These new ITNs cost substantially more than the current ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In the future we hope to see new ITNs manufactured to be as durable as possible to maximize both cost effectiveness and the duration of protection against malaria for those using ITNs. Procurement agencies need to start selecting ITNs based on their value for money and not just the lowest price.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Want to learn more about the ABCDR study?

        "description": "<p>A new study by Ifakara Health Institute and European partners has confirmed that treating anaemia using the iron infusion method is more effective and safer than using the current - standard - method of dispensing oral iron tablets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Findings of the study, published recently in <em>The Lancet Global Health</em>, show that iron infusion was found to be more feasible and safer compared to the standard iron-deficiency anaemia treatment using oral iron tablets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Intravenous iron substitution with ferric carboxymaltose was safe and yielded a better haemoglobin response than oral iron,&quot; the researchers say in their publication&rsquo;s abstract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ifakara Health Institute&#39;s Dr. Omar Lweno (pictured - inset) contributed equally to the publication with Dr. Fiona Vanobberghen of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH). Other contributors to the study include Dr. Andrea Kuemmerle from the Swiss TPH; Dr. Kwaba Dennis Mwebi; Peter Asilia; and Amina Issa - all from Ifakara Health Institute research sites in Tanzania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence of the benefits and safety of intravenous iron substitution in a low-income setting,&quot; the researchers claim. They say, the study has demonstrated that iron infusions can be safely used in rural African settings just as it is being used in high-income settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More: About the Study</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iron deficiency anaemia is of major concern in some low and middle-income settings, especially for women of childbearing age. Oral iron substitution efficacy is limited by poor compliance and iron depletion severity. The study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus oral iron substitution following childbirth in women with iron deficiency anaemia in Tanzania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two study sites were involved: the Bagamoyo District Hospital in Bagamoyo and the Mwananyamala Regional Referral Hospital in Dar es Salaam. A total of 533 individuals were screened in the study and 230 were successfully enrolled. It was conducted for one and half years between October 2015 and March 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study was implemented by Ifakara Health Institute in collaboration with the Swiss TPH with the financial support from the Vifor Pharma, Rudolf Geigy-Stiftung, Freiwillige Akademische Gesellschaft, and the Swiss TPH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read <em>The Lancet Global Health</em> article: <strong><span style=\"color:#00b050\"><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30448-4/fulltext#%20\" style=\"color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:#00b050\">Study finds alternative anaemia treatment safe, effective</span></a></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More: About Iron-Deficiency Anaemia</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iron deficiency anemia is a common type of anemia &mdash; a condition in which blood lacks adequate healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen to the body&#39;s tissues. As the name implies, iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient iron (Source: Mayor Clinic).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over 1 billion people globally are affected by iron-deficiency anaemia. In sub-Saharan Africa, anaemia is among the major public health concerns with roughly 60% of the population suffering from anaemia. Around half of those cases are due to iron deficiency. Anaemia has a negative impact on an individual&#39;s quality of life, and the economic development of a country. Women are at particularly high risk, and their risk increases during pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum. #</p>"

Geigy Foundation in a statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who is Dr. Kessy?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Kessy passed away in Ifakara in May last year. Until her death she was the Director of the TTCIH and an Associate Professor in Social Policy and Development at Mzumbe University.

OHI is an Institute at the University of California, Davis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a statement to commemorate this year&rsquo;s International Day of Women and Girls in Science shared on the OHI Official Facebook Page recently, the Institute says, as part of the OHI-led PREDICT project, the lab scientists helped to empower women in science and strengthen capacity for COVID-19 detection in East and West Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In Tanzania, detecting disease threats such as SARS-CoV-2 is in the hands of brilliant female scientists supporting the national laboratory system, scientists such as Ms. Sarah Mswata, Dr. Grace Mwangoka, Zena Emmanual, Ms. Happy Mkali, and Ms. Tunu Mwamlima.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the OHI, the lab scientists contribution is in line with this year&#39;s International Day of Women and Girls in Science theme, which is &lsquo;Women Scientists at the Forefront of the Fight Against COVID-19.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OHI notes that at both of PREDICT&rsquo;s partner labs in Tanzania (IHI and Sokoine University of Agriculture - SUA), women have been core to the disease detection workforce. &ldquo;In Bagamoyo, under Grace&rsquo;s mentorship, a new cadre of female leaders has been empowered and placed in key positions to support national health security,&rdquo; it says, adding:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;These women, some of whom started as students and in intern positions at PREDICT&rsquo;s SUA lab, are the current and future workforce standing between Tanzanians and the biological forces that threaten their health and livelihoods.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More about the One Health Institute</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 2009, the One Health Institute at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, works to solve complex global health challenges at the interface of people, animals, plants and the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OHI is home to the Karen C. Drayer Wildlife Health Center and many other programs and projects, including the PREDICT project, which Ifakara Heatlh Institute is part of. The Executive Director of the One Health Institute is Dr. Jonna Mazet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The One Health, commonly abbreviated in health cycles as &lsquo;OH,&rsquo; is an approach which recognizes that the health of domestic animals, wildlife, and people are inextricably linked to one another and the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About the International Day of Women and Girls in Science</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution to establish an annual International Day to recognize the critical role women and girls play in science and technology communities. In welcoming the efforts of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and other relevant organizations that support and promote the access of women and girls and their participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education, training and research activities decided to proclaim the 11th February of each year the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is the origin of the Day? Well! A significant gender gap has persisted throughout the years at all levels of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines all over the world. Even though women have made tremendous progress towards increasing their participation in higher education, they are still under-represented in these fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gender equality has always been a core issue for the United Nations. Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls will make a crucial contribution not only to economic development of the world, but to progress across all the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 14 March 2011, the Commission on the Status of Women adopted a report at its fifty-fifth session, with agreed conclusions on access and participation of women and girls in education, training and science and technology, and for the promotion of women&rsquo;s equal access to full employment and decent work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 20 December 2013, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on science, technology and innovation for development, in which it recognized that full and equal access to and participation in science, technology and innovation for women and girls of all ages is imperative for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. #</p>"

During the action-based dissemination of research findings, lack of nearby school was listed among the priority issues because it forced adolescents into mining.</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:42px\"><strong><span style=\"color:#473d6c\">03. One year down the road, after the participatory action based-dissemination workshop, the Kerezia community is building a new primary school.</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:42px\"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:42px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">In 2018, IHI Senior Social Scientist Dr. Sally Mtenga led a team to implement a participatory action-based dissemination of research findings which emerged from the formative study for Children in the Mining (CIM) project under the USAID funded Kizazi Kipya project led by Pact-Tanzania. The project aims to improve access to social-economic and health services for children living in the mining areas in Bukombe, Songwe and Chunya districts. The formative study was conducted by Dr. Emmy Metta, Ramadhani Abdul and Dr. Eveline Geubbels in collaboration with the Pact staff.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:42px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">Using the participatory action-based dissemination model, Dr. Mtenga and her team provided members of the Kerezia community an opportunity to reflect on the findings and develop a plan of action to address the social-economic problems that face children living in the mining areas and the aspects that encourage them to run into the mining areas. The villagers were guided to prioritize key challenges facing children living in the mining areas as informed by the formative study and prioritize actions and opportunities to address the challenges.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:42px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">This is what an excited village leader reported to Dr. Mtenga during her visit to the settlement a year after the dissemination: &ldquo;We remember you as our trainer during the seminar you organized for us last year. You told us to prepare our priorities on solutions that will address the problem of children not going to school but rushing to the mining areas. We had three priorities (water, road, and school).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:42px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">&ldquo;We are happy to tell you that one of our priorities has been implemented and through the efforts of community members, we have constructed a foundation for the primary school here in our village [........] because some of the schools here are very far away and sometimes children on their way to school would deviate and go to the mining areas. I was really wondering how I could see you and inform you about this progress. I once asked Yasinta (CMO) how I could reach you [....]. Excitedly, Dr Sally accompanied the village leaders to visit the school structure which was at its initial stage&quot;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\"><strong><span style=\"color:#473d6c\">Optimism as new school project takes off</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:20px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">After the action-based dissemination in 2017, a 10-men committee was formed to steer a new primary school construction project. During a visit made about a year after the dissemination event, the IHI Communications team saw walls of two classrooms and the office for teachers had already been erected. The next step from there is roofing. Members of this community are now optimistic that, with this commitment and the support from their partners in the development of Kerezia, the future was bright.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:20px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">The new school is being built on a seven-acre land bought by members of the Kerezia community through contributions and donations. The community&rsquo;s plan is building a total of nine classrooms &ndash; seven for the normal grades, one for aged children who couldn&rsquo;t join primary school on time due to various reasons, and one for the kindergartens.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:20px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">Most parents are very much concerned about the risks their children face to follow their studies at Buntubiri - the only nearby primary school in the area. Depending on the location of a particular house at Kerezia, the school is three to seven kilometers away. The new primary school under construction is a clear testimony of how community engagement informed by evidence can influence change at the grassroots. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\"><strong><span style=\"color:#473d6c\">Small contributions matter</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:20px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">Each member of Kerezia contributed TZS5,000 for the first phase of the project whose target is putting up three rooms &ndash; two classrooms and an office for teachers. Small miners operating in the settlement located some ten kilometers from Ushirombo &ndash; the Bukombe District headquarters &ndash; also contribute to the project, according to the coordinator of mining activities at Kerezia. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:20px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">People engaged in mining in the area and their partners coming to collect sand with gold concentrates have been cooperative in supporting school construction efforts. Buntubiri Village Executive Officer (VEO) Mr. Yusto Mabuga says plans are underway to sensitize parents with primary school-going children to also contribute for desks. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\"><strong><span style=\"color:#473d6c\">Take home message</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:42px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">The Kerezia story is a tangible exhibit that scientists need to go beyond the traditional methods of sharing research findings and apply a participatory action-based dissemination where possible to allow in-depth reflection on the research findings and actions that would influence change at the grass roots. Seeing our research contributing to the well-being aspect of the community is a success story to both, the Community, IHI, Pact, funders and other partners.#</span></p>",

We assessed the compliance of health workers with infection prevention and control practices relevant to COVID-19 in outpatient settings in Tanzania, before the pandemic.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><strong>Methods</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">This study was based on a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected as part of a randomized controlled trial in private for-profit dispensaries and health centers and in faith-based dispensaries, health centers, and hospitals, in 18 regions. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">We observed provider&ndash;patient interactions in outpatient consultation rooms, laboratories, and dressing rooms, and categorized infection prevention and control practices into four domains: hand hygiene, glove use, disinfection of reusable equipment, and waste management. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">We calculated compliance as the proportion of indications (infection risks) in which a health worker performed a correct action, and examined associations between compliance and health worker and facility characteristics using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\"><strong><span style=\"color:#473d6c\">Findings</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">Between Feb 7 and April 5, 2018, we visited 228 health facilities, and observed at least one infection prevention and control indication in 220 facilities (118 [54%] dispensaries, 66 [30%] health centres, and 36 [16%] hospitals). 18\u2008710 indications were observed across 734 health workers (49 [7%] medical doctors, 214 [29%] assistant medical officers or clinical officers, 106 [14%] nurses or midwives, 126 [17%] clinical assistants, and 238 [32%] laboratory technicians or assistants). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\"><strong>Compliance </strong>was 6&middot;9% for hand hygiene (n=8655 indications), 74&middot;8% for glove use (n=4915), 4&middot;8% for disinfection of reusable equipment (n=841), and 43&middot;3% for waste management (n=4299). Facility location was not associated with compliance in any of the infection prevention and control domains. Facility level and ownership were also not significantly associated with compliance, except for waste management. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\"><strong>For hand hygiene</strong>, nurses and midwives (odds ratio 5&middot;80 [95% CI 3&middot;91&ndash;8&middot;61]) and nursing and medical assistants (2&middot;65 [1&middot;67&ndash;4&middot;20]) significantly outperformed the reference category of assistant medical officers or clinical officers. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\"><strong>For glove use</strong>, nurses and midwives (10&middot;06 [6&middot;68&ndash;15&middot;13]) and nursing and medical assistants (5&middot;93 [4&middot;05&ndash;8&middot;71]) also significantly outperformed the reference category. Laboratory technicians performed significantly better in glove use (11&middot;95 [8&middot;98&ndash;15&middot;89]), but significantly worse in hand hygiene (0&middot;27 [0&middot;17&ndash;0&middot;43]) and waste management (0&middot;25 [0&middot;14&ndash;0&middot;44] than the reference category. Health worker age was negatively associated with correct glove use and female health workers were more likely to comply with hand hygiene. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\"><strong><span style=\"color:#473d6c\">Interpretation</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:19px; margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"color:#393260\">Health worker infection prevention and control compliance, particularly for hand hygiene and disinfection, was inadequate in these outpatient settings.

        "description": "<p><strong>By Fredros Okumu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is danger in their music. They party in our bedrooms all night, and boastfully lift their bloody abdomens while jigging on our insecticide-treated bed nets. Their ladies pierce our skins to extract blood, leaving small pints of saliva to sooth the itching. We swat haplessly, but they buzz away arrogantly showing off their freshly-acquired blood meals. Blood from our daughters, our sons and us. Just a few metres away, they stop to relax defiantly on our recently-sprayed walls, clearly undaunted by the large quantities of insecticides. Perhaps this is how they celebrate after injecting deadly malaria pathogens into their victims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may think we understand them, yet this is only one slice in the enigmatic life of mosquitoes, the deadliest predators of all time. To mark this year&#39;s World Mosquito Day, I share some reflections from Tanzania where the government and partners have achieved major successes against malaria in recent years, but where there is still a lot of room for improvement. Most malaria infections here are carried by just three mosquito species, namely Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus. In rare cases, other species may play minor roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Distinctive behaviors of mosquitoes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mosquitoes have distinctive behaviors which affect both their ability to carry pathogens and our ability to control them. Anopheles gambiae have an unquenchable preference for human blood, only rarely biting other animals. They also love to feed and rest inside people&rsquo;s dwellings as opposed to outdoors. These are excellent adaptations for transmitting human pathogens, but they also make the mosquitoes vulnerable to indoor interventions such as insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and house spraying. Indeed, these two strategies alone contributed 80% of all malaria cases prevented in Africa since 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anopheles arabiensis on the other hand very readily bites other animals when humans are absent or protected. They also frequently bite outside dwellings and can be found resting in pits or animal sheds. As a result, they have a lower capacity to transmit human pathogens. They are also less affected by ITNs or house spraying and can endure even the best organized campaigns. But the threat of malaria mosquitoes is not merely in their numbers. Ifakara Health Institute has been tracking Tanzania&rsquo;s malaria vectors for decades, working mainly in the south-eastern parts of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until 1990s, Anopheles gambiae had the highest densities and carried most of the malaria infections. However, its numbers started dwindling when bed nets, and later insecticides used to treat the nets, were introduced. In the beginning, the nets worked like magic, killing, repelling or simply starving millions of mosquitoes seeking human blood indoors. The programs were so effective that by 2008, only 20% of the malaria vectors in districts like Ulanga and Kilombero were the indoor-biting and human-loving Anopheles gambiae.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Tanzanian government and partners heightened the ITN campaigns, Anopheles gambiae virtually vanished in many villages. Starting 2012, it was absent in multiple villages across the two districts. Instead, the commonest species was now Anopheles arabiensis, which readily bites outdoors and can survive on livestock whenever humans are unavailable or under nets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malaria burden had also been dramatically reduced, and its severe form, dege-dege, largely stopped. Though Anopheles gambiae populations were not fully extinguished across the whole country, the impact on disease was huge and widespread. Malaria prevalence had been halved between 2000 and 2010, and continued declining to just 7.3% by 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&#39;Dangerous forces conspiring against best efforts&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But behind these glitters, dangerous forces were conspiring against Tanzania&rsquo;s best efforts, with potential to reverse the gains. First was the rise of Anopheles funestus, the small cryptic species which had remained mostly invisible during the reign of Anopheles gambiae, but was now steadily gaining territory with unrivalled vengeance. This mosquito has an amazing capacity to carry malaria but remains widely ignored and poorly-understood. Scientists do not adequately understand how it behaves, how it survives in nature and what makes it such a good pathogen carrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most laboratories cannot even colonize it, which could enable detailed studies on its biology and control. At Ifakara Health Institute (IHI), scientists regularly grind thousands of mosquito heads to test for malaria parasites in their saliva, a sign that the mosquito is infectious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As early as 2012 when Anopheles gambiae was disappearing, half of all malaria infections were already being spread by Anopheles funestus. By 2017, this proportion had risen to 80%, and today in some parts of Tanzania, Anopheles funestus transmits nearly nine in every ten new infections. This happens even where it has far lower population densities than other vectors, an extraordinary degree of dominance for such a poorly-known mosquito.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Anopheles funestus is ubiquitous across Tanzania, it probably already dominates in most other districts and regions as well. Indeed, its supremacy is already proven elsewhere in east Africa and across southern African countries, where it historically caused serious malaria epidemics. Unfortunately, this vector is now also super-resistant, and therefore impossible to kill with most insecticides available today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this was the second conspirator. Resistance in mosquito populations emerged due to excessive use of insecticides in public health and agriculture, which left vast quantities of chemical residues and put mosquitoes under unprecedented pressures to survive. In typical evolutionary fashion, the mosquitoes rapidly adapted. The fittest survived and multiplied. They released large quantities of enzymes to neutralize the pesticides or modified their body surfaces so that pesticides no longer penetrated. As a result, bed nets no longer kill enough mosquitoes to achieve impact beyond individual users. They may however remain effective by preventing biting if used consistently during sleeping hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain innovations such as bed nets treated with multiple chemicals or eave ribbons treated with wide-area repellents may improve these outcomes but are not yet widely available. Today, most malaria mosquitoes in Tanzania are resistant to multiple insecticides, and Anopheles funestus is the hardiest of them all. They are regularly observed surviving up to 10 times higher insecticide doses than other malaria vectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, there are currently no more than three insecticides registered in Tanzania that can effectively kill the mosquitoes. As a result, the practice of spraying houses, which was historically very effective, is now compromised. Moreover, if we do not deploy the currently available chemicals cleverly, we will lose this battle too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What must we do?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what then must we do? Well, in addition to current practices such as ITNs and house-spraying, we must begin a more sustainable program for improved housing and environmental management so that we may make our communities everlastingly free of the dangerous Anopheles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We must also continue strengthening our health systems to identify and treat new malaria cases. And we must expand access to health education in schools and households. Without these improvements, the deadly predators will most certainly continue dancing in our bedrooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>__________________</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Dr. Fredros Okumu is Director of Science at Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania.

        "description": "<p><strong>This is a practical guide for research directors in Africa on how to improve institutional ecosystems for the benefit of the next generation of scientists</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>By Fredros Okumu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Herry Mapesi is a young physician researcher based in Ifakara, some 450 kilometers from the Tanzanian economic capital of Dar es Salaam. He has the loudest laughter in town, and apart from being occasionally perceived as snobbish, he has a beautiful mind and an extraordinarily likeable character.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Herry and his colleagues run an 11,000 patient HIV clinic serving nearly 50 villages in the vast Kilombero Valley. About half of their patients are on regular follow up, receiving the best possible treatment for HIV and related illnesses, such as tuberculosis, meningitis, diabetes and chronic kidney diseases. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">When I last visited, 94% of their patients no longer had any detectable HIV virus in their blood, meaning they can no longer transmit the virus to their partners. Herry and team have created a clinic providing comprehensive treatment and nutritional services for families affected by HIV. Today, HIV-infected mothers who attend the clinic no longer transmit HIV to their children even if they breastfeed regularly.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Herry and his colleagues achieve these impressive outcomes despite working in remote areas with limited funds and resources. The team also works closely with Tanzanian health agencies to support the development and evaluation of improved care and treatment regimens for chronic Illnesses.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Herry and colleagues are research scientists at <a href=\"http://ihi.or.tz/\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box; color:blue; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:black\">Ifakara Health Institute</span></a> (IHI), where I&rsquo;m the Director of Science. Like all young scientists they write papers, attend research conferences, study for PhDs and apply for grants. Yet, their primary mission remains unchallenged: Improving people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing. Theirs is a research program with a difference. Their work&mdash;both clinical and research&mdash;profoundly impacts people&rsquo;s lives every day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">As a science director at one of the major African research organizations, I have a vested interest in understanding how we can best support young researchers like Herry. Over the past three years, I have examined management practices commonly used by organizations and businesses around the world to improve staff performance and creativity. This include carrying out multiple surveys and in-depth interviews with innovators and researchers in and outside Africa. In this article I share some of the lessons I learnt about challenges facing the continent&rsquo;s early-career researchers, and practices institutions can prioritize to help them succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">Challenges impeding high-quality research growth</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The challenges are many, and several aren&rsquo;t new. There are still only a handful of opportunities for high-quality research training on the continent, and unacceptably low levels of supervision and mentorship for young people aspiring to a life in research. Limited financial investment from governments has also hamstrung the growth of critical scientific mass, and hampered progress in exploratory but potentially high-impact research.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">There are also few role models, and science is still widely perceived as a club of bearded introverts and bookworms strongly averse to fun and fiercely unwelcoming to women&mdash;a situation keeping many talented youngsters away.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Another age-old challenge is the glorification of individual success over that of teams. This is driven in part by archaic ways of evaluating scientists based on publication counts, citations and research grants. Unchecked, young researchers easily adopt the ethos that they are &ldquo;competing against&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;with&rdquo; others. At IHI, Herry and colleagues have curtailed these toxic egos by embracing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:black\">African philosophy of <em>Ubuntu</em></span></a><em>: I am because you are</em>. Perhaps this is easier for young people than it is for their more established, Nobel-chasing godfathers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In addition, many African universities still run geographically segregated departments, despite <a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-760.html\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:black\">proof that interdisciplinary work has greater impact</span></a>. Engineering schools can be tens of kilometers from biological sciences or medical schools, effectively limiting opportunities to co-create solutions. Architectural and organizational innovations such as shared coffee lounges, subsidized cafeterias, open plan offices, or glass walls may help in certain circumstances, but are not enough to bridge these gaps.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">There are other challenges like excessive administrative and teaching loads for young faculty, and poor management practices. Language gaps, too, can prevent non-native speakers from taking full advantage of the English-dominated global research ecosystem. This is not a uniquely African concern but must be especially considered in African countries where French, Swahili, Portuguese or Spanish are the main languages of instruction.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#595959\">Here are five essentials to address the challenges</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#595959\">1. Provide effective supervision and mentorship</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">So, how can we start to tackle these challenges? In my view, the most important action we can take as research leaders is providing effective supervision and mentorship. This may include long-term commitments to guide early-career researchers on matters both related to work and not, such as engagement with communities or regulatory agencies, and family resettlement. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Institutions should create environments where supervision or mentorship arrangements are mutually agreed, rather than being institutionally enforced. Training programs should mix hard and easy tasks, so young people experience incrementally more difficult challenges for optimal learning. Alex Ezeh, former chief executive of the trail-blazing <a href=\"https://aphrc.org/\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:black\">African Population and Health Research Centre</span></a> based in Nairobi, once told me: &ldquo;You must occasionally throw your young researchers into the deep waters, but always be ready to dive in, if they are drowning.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">2. Maximize researcher-target population interactions</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The second action I propose is to maximize interactions between researchers and their target populations, communities or patients. This will help them identify priority questions first-hand and make them more likely to create or adapt solutions to fit local contexts. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">At IHI, community members are our most important stakeholders, and we take great pains to protect our partnerships with them. This is also the reason that colleagues like Herry and his team have remained impactful despite being so far from the tarmac, and so limited by financing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Communities can also be great sources of new knowledge for researchers, making these partnerships perfect for &ldquo;mutual learning&rdquo;. For example, after expert mosquito biologists had tried fruitlessly for more than 30 years, it was the young village boys who showed us the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5691375/\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:black\">exact locations where malaria mosquitoes congregate each evening for their ritualistic sex games</span></a>, a discovery which could allow scientists to target these mosquitoes for community-wide control.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">3. Create interdisciplinary programs</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The third action is to deliberately and actively create interdisciplinary programs. At IHI, young researchers now regularly combine math, chemistry and biology to create <a href=\"https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-019-2982-9\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:black\">new diagnostics for infectious diseases like malaria</span></a>, something only possible because of the active desegregation of disciplines. Others are using portable <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/6/4/ofz154/5427906\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:black\">ultrasound devices to limit potentially toxic treatments for people falsely diagnosed with tuberculosis</span></a>.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">4. Build sustainable research ecosystems and careers</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">On funding, we need to focus on building sustainable research ecosystems and careers. With growing financial constraints and economic vigilance, research and academic institutions can be tempted to operate on a traditional profit and loss basis, as if they were typical businesses. However, investments in science are mostly long-term, and returns take several years to materialize. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Equally important are semi-autonomous and flexible leadership structures. These should embrace efficient administrative and financial systems, which meet international standards without ignoring research priorities. Sadly, bottlenecks like delayed contracts or slow procurement procedures are still common in many universities, and enormously demotivating for scientists.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">5. Identify barriers, endeavor to overcome them</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Finally, institutions should identify barriers to women and under-represented groups joining their ranks, and advancing in the workplace, then endeavor to overcome these barriers. There is strong evidence that <a href=\"https://hbr.org/topic/diversity\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:black\">gender and cultural diversities are both associated with higher performance in workplaces</span></a>, and diversity requires a commitment from the top.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">How to do it</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Those are five ways in which we, as leaders of research institutions in Africa, can help our young colleagues thrive. But how do we do it? And what incentives should we use to encourage change? Should we use direct incentives, for example paying scientists for each research paper?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Well, it turns out nothing works better than <a href=\"https://www.dalecarnegie.com/en\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:black\">Dale Carnegie&rsquo;s principle of honestly and sincerely appreciating people</span></a>. Financial or material incentives beyond regular institutional pay grades are unsustainable and can backfire with serious cobra effects. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">For those who don&rsquo;t know this idiom, the cobra effect harks back to an anecdote from colonial-rule India. Wanting to reduce the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi, the British offered a bounty on dead cobras. Soon, people began breeding cobras to collect the bounty, and when British scrapped the reward program the breeders set their snakes free&mdash;pushing the wild cobra population beyond what it was before the program was introduced.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the same way, financial incentives for publishing in high impact journals may lead to unscrupulous practices, such as fabricating data, which can be devastating to an institution&rsquo;s reputation. While it can be tempting for managers to provide material incentives in the short term, staff may come to feel entitled to these rewards, creating a vicious cycle of institutions always having to give more. Cultivating intrinsic motivation and recognizing hard work are far more effective for maintaining long-term success.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">My five actions are only a few examples of what institutions in Africa can do to catalyze effective ecosystems for their early-career researchers. A careful mix of these practices and others not covered here, will allow young stars like Herry and friends to shine brighter, while staying true to their mission: Improving people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>__________________</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"color:black\">Fredros Okumu</span></em></strong><em><span style=\"color:black\"> is Director of Science at Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania, and an Associate Professor at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa.

        "description": "<p><strong><span style=\"color:#073763\">When a young man washes his hands clean, he shall be allowed to eat with the elders!</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Writes Dr. Fredros Okumu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once during a mosquito hunting expedition in 2012, the friendly ferry driver invited me to his cabin for a little town gossip. We often spoke about life in the villages and how the annual flooding of the Kilombero valley brought blessings to subsistence farmers but also disease-carrying mosquitoes to the villages. We discussed their struggles to keep the old pontoons running everyday so people did not have to use dangerous canoes to cross the river with their goods, farm implements and animals</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ferry driver had been a friend for a long time and had transported us across the mighty Kilombero river several times in the seasons. Often when we were late from our mosquito-hunting expeditions, they would keep the ferry running beyond their 7pm closing time, just to bring us home. This was their contribution to the fight we were waging against the deadly malaria mosquitoes in the valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On this day, after the gossip was done, the Ferry driver casually introduced me to a young man, his distant cousin, Salum, who had moved to live with him temporarily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salum was shy but special in many dimensions. He had completed his advanced secondary education but had decided not to proceed to college, so he could find a job to take care of his ailing mother. I learned that he was a little kid with big responsibilities. He was also obviously a very clever kid, and I was certain of this before our 5-minute ferry ride ended. Salum requested if he could volunteer in our research group, to work with mosquitoes, perhaps silently hoping he would make a small daily wage to support his family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I initially declined this request, primarily because I was worried that it would waste his time, and lead him further from college. But he was persistent. So, after a few more interactions Salum and I struck a deal. A very simple deal, which would become one of my greatest lessons in career building in low-income settings. We agreed to let Salum join us on condition that he would immediately register for a long-distance degree classes, at the Tanzanian Open University. We covered his costs initially and maintained him on our payroll as a non-skilled staff, initially at the lowest grade, earning just 150 USD/month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He worked diligently and scaled the ranks, eventually taking over his own course fees after just two years. He established himself as a highly reliable and dependable team player, and mastered every imaginable research technique in our laboratory. He particularly tackled difficult subjects, including rigging an infrared video system to observe mosquitoes in darkness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At one time, we sent him to Germany for 4 weeks, and there they co-designed a beautiful smell machine to study how mosquitoes sense the aroma of humans. This is now installed at Ifakara. He supported our initial surveys on how mosquitoes respond to insecticides, and was always there to do more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was meticulous, extraordinarily scholarly and amazingly helpful to other scientists. All this time, he blended into thin air and was mostly unrecognized. Yet, he remained the icon of his family, and an anchor in our activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salum completed his undergraduate degree in 2017, and competed successfully for a Wellcome Trust International Masters Fellowship, which he won. Some of you may remember how excited we were when we received the news of his fellowship. Indeed, of all the fellowships I have supported over the years, this was the most special. The grant allowed him 30 months, including 12 months as a master degree student at a top UK school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salum, has just returned to Tanzania, having spent a year in the UK, and will continue with his research this time investigating ways to control dominant malaria vectors in rural villages. What&rsquo;s really cool, is that he scored top marks, and together with his colleague Felician, they had fantastic reviews from their professors. Both of them finished with a rare distinction in the 2019 class of Master of Science in Molecular Parasitology &amp; Vector Biology, awarded jointly by University of Salford and Keele University. Truly this is what I usually mean when I say the future looks like our young people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salum remains committed to addressing the challenges of local communities. He believes that he and his colleagues have a responsibility to improve the health and wellbeing of our people. And that Ifakara Health Institute is the most perfect home for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of Salum represents many across low-income communities who desire to join a research career but face multiple barriers. Except, the future looks exactly like them. In many ways, they bring the oomph that we must have to address the world&rsquo;s toughest public health challenges. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I must end now, I say unto you Salum. When a young man washes his hands clean, he gets to eat with the elders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>__________________________</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"color:black\">Fredros Okumu</span></em></strong><em><span style=\"color:black\"> is Director of Science at Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania, and an Associate Professor at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa.

        "abstract": "Background\r\nAnopheles funestus mosquitoes currently contribute more than 85% of ongoing malaria transmission events in south-eastern Tanzania, even though they occur in lower densities than other vectors, such as Anopheles arabiensis. Unfortunately, the species ecology is minimally understood, partly because of difficulties in laboratory colonization. This study describes the first observations of An. funestus swarms in Tanzania, possibly heralding new opportunities for control.\r\n\r\nMethod\r\nUsing systematic searches by community-based volunteers and expert entomologists, An. funestus swarms were identified in two villages in Ulanga and Kilombero districts in south-eastern Tanzania, starting June 2018. Swarms were characterized by size, height, start- and end-times, presence of copulation and associated environmental features. Samples of male mosquitoes from the swarms were examined for sexual maturity by observing genitalia rotation, species identity using polymerase chain reaction and wing sizes.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n581 An. funestus (98.1% males (n\u2009=\u2009570) and 1.9% (n\u2009=\u200911) females) and 9 Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) males were sampled using sweep nets from the 81 confirmed swarms in two villages (Ikwambi in Kilombero district and Tulizamoyo in Ulanga district). Six copulation events were observed in the swarms. Mean density (95% CL) of An. funestus caught/swarm/village/evening was 6.6 (5.9\u20137.2) in Tulizamoyo and 10.8 (5.8\u201315.8) in Ikwambi. 87.7% (n\u2009=\u200971) of the swarms were found in Tulizamoyo, while 12.3% (n\u2009=\u200910) were in Ikwambi. Mean height of swarms was 1.7 m (0.9\u20132.5 m), while mean duration was 12.9 (7.9\u201317.9) minutes. The PCR analysis confirmed that 100% of all An. funestus s.l. samples processed were An. funestus sensu stricto. Mean wing length of An. funestus males was 2.47 mm (2.0\u20132.8 mm), but there was no difference between swarming males and indoor-resting males. Most swarms (95.0%) occurred above bare ground, sometime on front lawns near human dwellings, and repeatedly in the same locations.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThis study has demonstrated occurrence of An. funestus swarms for the first time in Tanzania. Further investigations could identify new opportunities for improved control of this dominant malaria vector, possibly by targeting the swarms."

        "abstract": "Background\r\nMalaria cases and deaths decreased dramatically in recent years, largely due to effective vector control interventions. Persistence of transmission after good coverage has been achieved with high-quality vector control interventions, namely insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying, poses a significant challenge to malaria elimination efforts. To understand when and where remaining transmission is occurring, it is necessary to look at vector and human behaviour, and where they overlap. To date, a review of human behaviour related to residual malaria transmission has not been conducted.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nStudies were identified through PubMed and Google Scholar. Hand searches were conducted for all references cited in articles identified through the initial search. The review was limited to English language articles published between 2000 and 2017. Publications with primary data from a malaria endemic setting in sub-Saharan Africa and a description of night time human behaviours were included.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nTwenty-six publications were identified that met inclusion criteria. Study results fit into two broad categories: when and where people are exposed to malaria vectors and what people are doing at night that may increase their contact with malaria vectors. Among studies that quantified human-vector interaction, a majority of exposure occurred indoors during sleeping hours for unprotected individuals, with some variation across time, contexts, and vector species. Common night time activities across settings included household chores and entertainment during evening hours, as well as livelihood and large-scale socio-cultural events that can last throughout the night. Shifting sleeping patterns associated with travel, visitors, illness, farming practices, and outdoor sleeping, which can impact exposure and use of prevention measures, were described in some locations.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nWhile the importance of understanding human-vector interaction is well-established, relatively few studies have included human behaviour when measuring exposure to malaria vectors. Broader application of a standardized approach to measuring human-vector interaction could provide critical information on exposure across settings and over time. In-depth understanding of night time activities that occur during times when malaria vectors are active and barriers to prevention practices in different contexts should also be considered. This information is essential for targeting existing interventions and development and deployment of appropriate complementary prevention tools"

        "abstract": "Background\r\nProgress in health service quality is vital to reach the target of Universal Health Coverage. However, in order to improve quality, it must be measured, and the assessment results must be actionable. We analyzed an electronic tool, which was developed to assess and monitor the quality of primary healthcare in Tanzania in the context of routine supportive supervision. The electronic assessment tool focused on areas in which improvements are most effective in order to suit its purpose of routinely steering improvement measures at local level.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nDue to the lack of standards regarding how to best measure quality of care, we used a range of different quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the appropriateness of the quality assessment tool. The quantitative methods included descriptive statistics, linear regression models, and factor analysis; the qualitative methods in-depth interviews and observations.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nQuantitative and qualitative results were overlapping and consistent. Robustness checks confirmed the tool\u2019s ability to assign scores to health facilities and revealed the usefulness of grouping indicators into different quality dimensions. Focusing the quality assessment on processes and structural adequacy of healthcare was an appropriate approach for the assessment\u2019s intended purpose, and a unique key feature of the electronic assessment tool. The findings underpinned the accuracy of the assessment tool to measure and monitor quality of primary healthcare for the purpose of routinely steering improvement measures at local level. This was true for different level and owner categories of primary healthcare facilities in Tanzania.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe electronic assessment tool demonstrated a feasible option for routine quality measures of primary healthcare in Tanzania. The findings, combined with the more operational results of companion papers, created a solid foundation for an approach that could lastingly improve services for patients attending primary healthcare. However, the results also revealed that the use of the electronic assessment tool outside its intended purpose, for example for performance-based payment schemes, accreditation and other systematic evaluations of healthcare quality, should be considered carefully because of the risk of bias, adverse effects and corruption."

        "abstract": "In Tanzania, the health financing system is extremely fragmented with strategies in place to supplement funds provided from the central level. One of these strategies is the Community Health Fund (CHF), a voluntary health insurance scheme for the informal rural sector. As its implementation has been challenging, we investigated different CHF implementation practices and how these practices and the wider health financing context affect CHF implementation and potentially enrolment. Two councils were purposively selected for this study. Routine data relevant for understanding CHF implementation in the wider health financing context were collected at council and public health facility level. Additionally, an economic costing approach was used to estimate CHF administration cost and analyse its financing sources. Our results showed the importance of considering different CHF implementation practices and the wider health financing context when looking at CHF performance. Exemption policies and healthcare-seeking behaviour influenced negatively the maximum potential enrolment rate of the voluntary CHF scheme. Higher revenues from user fees, user fee policies and fund pooling mechanisms might have furthermore set incentives for care providers to prioritize user fees over CHF revenues. Costing results clearly pointed out the lack of financial sustainability of the CHF. The financial analysis however also showed that thanks to significant contributions from other health financing mechanisms to CHF administration, the CHF could be left with more than 70% of its revenues for financing services. To make the CHF work, major improvements in CHF implementation practices would be needed, but given the wider health financing context and healthcare-seeking behaviours, it is questionable whether such improvements are feasible, scalable and value for money. Thus, our results call for a reconsideration of approaches taken to address the challenges in health financing and demonstrate that the CHF cannot be looked at as a stand-alone system"

        "abstract": "Background\r\nMalaria can be transmitted by blood transfusion from human to human and it is responsible for the majority of transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases worldwide. In sub-Saharan Africa, it had been estimated that almost a quarter of blood donations contain malaria parasites. Since rapid diagnostic tests and thick blood smear microscopy lack sensitivity for low density parasitaemia, particularly in asymptomatic adults, the most reliable method to assess the problem of transfusion-transmitted malaria are nucleic acid-based molecular approaches such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of sub-microscopic malaria parasite infection among blood donors in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nBetween July and August 2017, a total of 200 individual blood samples from blood donors at the Malabo Blood Bank were collected and screened by rapid diagnostic tests and thick blood smear microscopy. Retrospectively, the same samples were analysed for the presence of undetected, low-density malaria parasites using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nIn comparison to 6.5% (13/200) by rapid diagnostic test and 2.0% (4/200) by microscopy, the proportion of Plasmodium falciparum positive blood donations analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction was significantly higher (26%, 52/200). Densities of P. falciparum positive blood donations were ranging from 0.06 to 3707.0 parasites/\u00b5L with 79.6% below 100 parasites/\u00b5L and therefore not detectable by non-molecular malaria diagnostic tests. qPCR based species identification revealed that P. falciparum was the dominating species responsible for 88.1% (52/59) of positive blood donations, followed by Plasmodium malariae (15.3%, 9/59) and Plasmodium ovale (3.4%, 2/59).\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThis study confirms that in malaria endemic settings, sub-patent malaria infections among blood donors are prevalent. In blood collected from healthy donors living in Malabo, P. falciparum, P. malariae and P. ovale parasites were identified. Currently widely used malaria diagnostic tools have missed more than 75% of P. falciparum containing blood donations, demonstrating the value of quantitative polymerase chain reaction to reliably detect low density P. falciparum infections. Since the availability of molecular diagnostic methods in malaria endemic countries is still limited, the blood recipients living in malaria endemic countries should be treated following WHO recommendations"

        "abstract": "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is one of the major viral zoonoses in Africa, affecting humans and several domestic animal species. The epidemics in eastern Africa occur in a 5-15 year cycle coinciding with abnormally high rainfall generally associated to the warm phase of the El Ni\u00f1o event. However, recently, evidence has been gathered of inter-epidemic transmission. An open-source, easily applicable, accessible and modifiable model was built to simulate the transmission dynamics of RVF. The model was calibrated using data collected in the Kilombero Valley in Tanzania with people and cattle as host species and \u00c6des mcintoshi, \u00c6. \u00e6gypti and two Culex species as vectors. Simulations were run over a period of 27 years using standard parameter values derived from two previous studies in this region. Our model predicts low-level transmission of RVF, which is in line with epidemiological studies in this area. Emphasis in our simulation was put on both the dynamics and composition of vector populations in three ecological zones, in order to elucidate the respective roles played by different vector species: the model output did indicate the necessity of Culex involvement and also indicated that vertical transmission in \u00c6des mcintoshi may be underestimated. This model, being built with open-source software and with an easy-to-use interface, can be adapted by researchers and control program managers to their specific needs by plugging in new parameters relevant to their situation and locality."

In patients aged at least 50 years, arterial hypertension was highly prevalent (43.8%), but not associated with mortality/LTFU [hazard ratios 1.04 (95% CI 0.56\u20131.93), P\u200a=\u200a0.9]. Undernutrition ranged from 25.5% in the youngest to 29.1% in the oldest age group and contributed to mortality/LTFU [hazard ratios 2.24 (95% CI 1.65\u20133.04); P\u200a<\u200a0.001]. Prevalence of tuberculosis was 21.4% with hazard ratios of 2.54 (95% CI 1.72\u20133.75, P\u200a<\u200a0.001) for mortality/LTFU.\r\nConclusion:\r\nWe show that anaemia, arterial hypertension and undernutrition are the most relevant comorbidities with different age-associated frequencies and impact on death/LTFU in this population"

        "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is the major risk factor predisposing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis progression from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to tuberculosis disease (TB). Since long-term-treated aviremic HIV-infected individuals remained at higher risk of developing TB than HIV-uninfected individuals, we hypothesized that progression from LTBI to pulmonary TB (PTB) might be due not only to CD4 T-cell depletion but also to M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 T-cell functional impairment. To test this hypothesis, M. tuberculosis-specific T-cell frequencies and cytokine profiles were investigated in untreated Tanzanian individuals suffering from LTBI (n = 20) or PTB (n = 67) and compared to those of untreated M. tuberculosis/HIV-coinfected individuals suffering from LTBI (n = 15) or PTB (n = 10). We showed that HIV infection significantly reduced the proportion of Th2 (interleukin 4 [IL-4]/IL-5/IL-13) producing M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 T cells and IL-2-producing M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in individuals with LTBI or PTB (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Interestingly, the loss of IL-2 production was associated with a significant increase of PD-1 expression on M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells (P\u2009<\u20090.05), while the loss of Th2 cytokine production was associated with a significant reduction of Gata-3 expression in memory CD4 T cells (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Finally, we showed that the serum levels of IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-23, and IP-10 were significantly reduced in M. tuberculosis/HIV-coinfected individuals with PTB compared to those in HIV-negative individuals with PTB (P\u2009<\u20090.05), suggesting that HIV infection significantly suppresses M. tuberculosis-induced systemic proinflammatory cytokine responses. Taken together, this study suggests that in addition to depleting M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 T cells, HIV infection significantly impairs functionally favorable M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 T-cell responses in Tanzanian individuals with LTBI or PTB.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are coendemic in several regions of the world, and M. tuberculosis/HIV-coinfected individuals are more susceptible to progression to tuberculosis disease. We therefore hypothesized that HIV infection would potentially impair M. tuberculosis-specific protective immunity in individuals suffering from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) or active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). In this study, we demonstrated that M. tuberculosis/HIV-coinfected individuals have fewer circulating M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 T cells and that those that remained were functionally impaired in both LTBI and PTB settings. In addition, we showed that HIV infection significantly interferes with M. tuberculosis-induced systemic proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses. Taken together, these data suggest that HIV infection impairs functionally favorable M. tuberculosis-specific immunity."

        "abstract": "Background\r\nTargeting swarms of male Anopheles mosquitoes with techniques such as aerosol spraying could potentially suppress malaria vector populations and parasite transmission. Unfortunately, research on Anopheles swarming behaviours is limited, particularly in East Africa where only a handful of studies have been done. New evidence has recently emerged that such swarms are common even in Tanzania, where they could be readily identified and characterized by community-based volunteers, and potentially targeted for control. However, improved understanding of public knowledge and perceptions will be crucial for successful uptake of any interventions targeting swarms.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nExplanatory sequential mixed methods approach was used to assess knowledge and perceptions regarding mosquito swarms among community members in Ulanga and Kilombero districts, south-eastern Tanzania. A survey questionnaire was administered to 307 respondents, after which focus group discussions were conducted to clarify responses regarding mosquito swarms and malaria transmission. Findings from both study components were used to draw qualitative inferences.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nMost community members (83%) had previously seen mosquito swarms, predominantly in farms, over long grasses or bushes, above ponds and over roofs of houses and pit-latrines. However, there was little evidence that community members could distinguish between mosquito swarms and those of other insects. Neither were they aware that swarms consisted mostly of male mosquitoes. Swarming was associated with mosquitoes preparing to attack people, foraging for food, playing or resting. Very few respondents associated swarming with mosquito mating. Nearly all community members were willing to accept interventions targeting mosquito swarms; and approximately three quarters would pay for such interventions, between 0.9 and 2.3 USD/year.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nMajority of the community members recognized presence of mosquito swarms in their communities but did not associate these swarms with mosquito mating. Instead, swarming was associated with mosquitoes seeking food or planning to attack people, and thus were generally considered dangerous. This understanding created the basis for wide-acceptance of interventions targeting swarming mosquitoes. Although the likelihood of actual interventions targeting swarms is still low, such community knowledge will be crucial in future field studies of mosquito swarms and possible inclusion of community members in mosquito control efforts."

Children aged 2\u201359 months with fever and cough and without life-threatening conditions received an antibiotic based on a CRP-informed strategy (combination of CRP \u226580 mg/L plus age/temperature-corrected tachypnea and/or chest indrawing) or current World Health Organization standard (respiratory rate \u226550 breaths/minute).

However, many facilities provide sub\u2010optimal quality of care, which may be a reason for less than universal facility utilisation. We assessed the impact of a quality improvement project on facility utilisation for childbirth.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nIn this cluster\u2010randomised experiment in four rural districts in Tanzania, 12 primary care clinics and their catchment areas received a quality improvement intervention consisting of in\u2010service training, mentoring and supportive supervision, infrastructure support, and peer outreach, while 12 facilities and their catchment areas functioned as controls. We conducted a census of all deliveries within the catchment area and used difference\u2010in\u2010differences analysis to determine the intervention's effect on facility utilisation for childbirth. We conducted a secondary analysis of utilisation among women whose prior delivery was at home. We further investigated mechanisms for increased facility utilisation.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe intervention led to an increase in facility births of 6.7 percentage points from a baseline of 72% (95% Confidence Interval: 0.6, 12.8). The intervention increased facility delivery among women with past home deliveries by 18.3 percentage points (95% CI: 10.1, 26.6). Antenatal quality increased in intervention facilities with providers performing an additional 0.5 actions across the full population and 0.8 actions for the home delivery subgroup.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nWe attribute the increased use of facilities to better antenatal quality. This increased utilisation would lead to lower maternal mortality only in the presence of improvement in care quality."

Factors associated with incomplete vaccination are relatively well characterized in resource-limited settings; however, few studies have assessed immunization timeliness.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nWe conducted a prospective cohort study examining Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTP) vaccination timing among newborns enrolled in a Neonatal Vitamin A supplementation trial (NEOVITA) conducted in urban Dar es Salaam (n\u2009=\u200911,189) and rural Morogoro Region (n\u2009=\u200919,767), Tanzania. We used log-binomial models to assess the relationship of demographic, socioeconomic, healthcare access, and birth characteristics with late or incomplete DTP1 and DTP3 immunization.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe proportion of infants with either delayed or incomplete vaccination was similar in Dar es Salaam (DTP1 11.5% and DTP3 16.0%) and Morogoro (DTP1 9.2% and DTP3 17.3%); however, the determinants of delayed or incomplete vaccination as well as their magnitude of association differed by setting. Both maternal and paternal education were more strongly associated with vaccination status in rural Morogoro region as compared to Dar es Salaam (p-values for heterogeneity <\u20090.05). Infants in Morogoro who had fathers and mothers with no education had 36% (95% CI: 22\u201352%) and 22% (95% CI: 10\u201334%) increased risk of delayed or incomplete DTP3 vaccination as compared to those with primary school education, respectively. In Dar es Salaam, mothers who attended their first antenatal care (ANC) visit in the 3rd trimester had 1.55 (95% CI: 1.36\u20131.78) times the risk of delayed or not received vaccination as compared to those with a 2nd trimester booking, while there was no relationship in Morogoro. In rural Morogoro, infants born at home had 17% (95% CI: 8\u201327%) increased risk for delayed or no receipt of DTP3 vaccination. In both settings, younger maternal age and poorer households were at increased risk for delayed or incomplete vaccination.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nWe found some risk factors for delayed and incomplete vaccination were shared between urban and rural Tanzania; however, we found several context-specific risk factors as well as determinants that differed in their magnitude of risk between contexts.

In 2016, efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria were assessed through a TES conducted between April and October 2016 at four sentinel sites of Kibaha, Mkuzi, Mlimba, and Ujiji in Tanzania. The study also assessed molecular markers of artemisinin and lumefantrine (partner drug) resistance.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nEligible patients were enrolled at the four sites, treated with standard doses of AL, and monitored for 28 days with clinical and laboratory assessments. The main outcomes were PCR corrected cure rates, day 3 positivity rates, safety of AL, and prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 (Pfk13) (codon positions: 440\u2013600) and P. falciparum multi-drug resistance 1 (Pfmdr1) genes (codons: N86Y, Y184F and D1246Y), markers of artemisinin and lumefantrine resistance, respectively.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nOf 344 patients enrolled, three withdrew, six were lost to follow-up; and results were analysed for 335 (97.4%) patients. Two patients had treatment failure (one early treatment failure and one recrudescent infection) after PCR correction, yielding an adequate clinical and parasitological response of\u2009>\u200998%. Day 3 positivity rates ranged from 0 to 5.7%. Common adverse events included cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Two patients had serious adverse events; one died after the first dose of AL and another required hospitalization after the second dose of AL (on day 0) but recovered completely. Of 344 samples collected at enrolment (day 0), 92.7% and 100% were successfully sequenced for Pfk13 and Pfmdr1 genes, respectively. Six (1.9%) had non-synonymous mutations in Pfk13, none of which had been previously associated with artemisinin resistance. For Pfmdr1, the NFD haplotype (codons N86, 184F and D1246) was detected in 134 (39.0%) samples; ranging from 33.0% in Mlimba to 45.5% at Mkuzi. The difference among the four sites was not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.578). All samples had a single copy of the Pfmdr1 gene.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe study indicated high efficacy of AL and the safety profile was consistent with previous reports. There were no known artemisinin-resistance Pfk13 mutations, but there was a high prevalence of a Pfmdr1 haplotype associated with reduced sensitivity to lumefantrine (but no reduced efficacy was observed in the subjects). Continued TES and monitoring of markers of resistance to artemisinin and partner drugs is critical for early detection of resistant parasites and to inform evidence-based malaria treatment policies.\r\n\r\nTrial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03387631"

        "abstract": "Background\r\nIn the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, rapid and spontaneous scale-up of window screening occurred through purely horizontal commercial distribution systems without any public subsidies or promotion. Scale-up of window screening coincided with a planned evaluation of programmatic, vertically managed scale-up of regular larvicide application as an intervention against malaria vectors and transmission. We aimed to establish whether scale-up of window screening was associated with suppression of mosquito populations, especially for malaria vectors that strongly prefer humans as their source of blood.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nThis study was a re-analysis of a previous observational series of epidemiological data plus new analyses of previously partly reported complementary entomological data, from Dar es Salaam. Between 2004 and 2008, six rounds of cluster-sampled, rolling, cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire surveys were done in urban Dar es Salaam to assess the effect of larviciding and other determinants of malaria risk, such as use of bed nets and antimalarial drugs, socioeconomic status, age, sex, travel history, mosquito-proofed housing, and spending time outdoors. The effects of scaled-up larvicide application and window screening were estimated by fitting generalised linear mixed models that allowed for both spatial variation between survey locations and temporal autocorrelation within locations. We also conducted continuous longitudinal entomological surveys of outdoor human biting rates by mosquitoes and experimental measurements of mosquito host preferences.\r\n\r\nFindings\r\nBest-fit models of Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection prevalence among humans were largely consistent with the results of the previous analyses. Re-analysis of previously reported epidemiological data revealed that most of the empirically fitted downward time trend in P falciparum malaria prevalence over the course of the study (odds ratio [OR] 0\u00b704; 95% CI 0\u00b703\u20130\u00b706; p<0\u00b70001), which was not previously reported numerically or attributed to any explanatory factor, could be plausibly explained by association with an upward trend in city-wide window screening coverage (OR 0\u00b707; 0\u00b705\u20130\u00b709; p<0\u00b70001) and progressive rollout of larviciding (OR 0\u00b750; 0\u00b741\u20130\u00b760; p<0\u00b70001). Increasing coverage of complete window screening was also associated with reduced biting densities of all taxonomic groups of mosquitoes (all p<0\u00b70001), especially the Anopheles gambiae complex (relative rate [RR] 0\u00b723; 95% CI 0\u00b716\u20130\u00b733) and Anopheles funestus group (RR 0\u00b708; 0\u00b704\u20130\u00b716), which were confirmed as the most efficient vectors of malaria with strong preferences for humans over cattle. Larviciding was also associated with reduced biting densities of all mosquito taxa (p<0\u00b70001), to an extent that varied consistently with the larvicide targeting scheme and known larval ecology of each taxon.\r\n\r\nInterpretation\r\nCommunity-wide mosquito proofing of houses might deliver greater impacts on vector populations and malaria transmission than previously thought. The spontaneous nature of the scale-up observed here is also encouraging with regards to practicality, acceptability, and affordability in low-income settings.\r\n\r\nFunding\r\nUnited States Agency for International Development, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, and Valent BioSciences LLC"

        "abstract": "Demand side financing strategies have been a popular means of increasing coverage and availability of effective maternal and child health services in low and middle income countries (LMIC). However, most research to date has focused on the effects of demand side financing on the use and costs of care with less attention being paid to how they work to achieve outcomes. This study used a mixed methods evaluation to determine the effect of a targeted health insurance scheme on access to affordable quality maternal and child care, and assess implementation fidelity and how this affected programme outcomes.\r\n\r\nProgramme effects on service access, affordability and quality were evaluated using difference in difference regression analysis, with outcomes being measured through facility, patient and household surveys and observations of care before the intervention started and eighteen months later. A simultaneous process evaluation was designed as a case study of the implementation experience. A total of 90 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and five focus group discussions were conducted during three rounds of data collection among respondents from management, facility and community. The scheme achieved high coverage among the target population and reduced the amount paid for antenatal and delivery care; however, there was no effect on service coverage and limited effects on quality of care. The lack of programme effects was partly due to the late timing of first antenatal care visits and registration for the scheme together with limited understanding of entitlements among beneficiaries and providers.\r\n\r\nBetter communication of programme benefits is needed to enhance effects together with integration of such schemes within existing purchasing mechanisms and in financially decentralised health systems."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\r\nSurgical intervention is needed in some cases of spontaneous abortion to remove retained products of conception. Antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of pelvic infection, which is an important complication of this surgery, particularly in low-resource countries.\r\n\r\nMETHODS\r\nWe conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial investigating whether antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery to complete a spontaneous abortion would reduce pelvic infection among women and adolescents in low-resource countries. We randomly assigned patients to a single preoperative dose of 400 mg of oral doxycycline and 400 mg of oral metronidazole or identical placebos. The primary outcome was pelvic infection within 14 days after surgery. Pelvic infection was defined by the presence of two or more of four clinical features (purulent vaginal discharge, pyrexia, uterine tenderness, and leukocytosis) or by the presence of one of these features and the clinically identified need to administer antibiotics. The definition of pelvic infection was changed before the unblinding of the data; the original strict definition was two or more of the clinical features, without reference to the administration of antibiotics.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nWe enrolled 3412 patients in Malawi, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda. A total of 1705 patients were assigned to receive antibiotics and 1707 to receive placebo. The risk of pelvic infection was 4.1% (68 of 1676 pregnancies) in the antibiotics group and 5.3% (90 of 1684 pregnancies) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 1.04; P=0.09). Pelvic infection according to original strict criteria was diagnosed in 1.5% (26 of 1700 pregnancies) and 2.6% (44 of 1704 pregnancies), respectively (risk ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.96). There were no significant between-group differences in adverse events.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nAntibiotic prophylaxis before miscarriage surgery did not result in a significantly lower risk of pelvic infection, as defined by pragmatic broad criteria, than placebo.

        "abstract": "Background\r\nMosquito biting rates and host preferences are crucial determinants of human exposure to vector-borne diseases and the impact of vector control measures. The human landing catch (HLC) is a gold standard method for measuring human exposure to bites, but presents risks to participants by requiring some exposure to mosquito vectors. Mosquito electrocuting traps (METs) represent an exposure-free alternative to HLCs for measuring human exposure to malaria vectors. However, original MET prototypes were too small for measuring whole-body biting rates on humans or large animals like cattle. Here a much larger MET capable of encompassing humans or cattle was designed, and its performance was evaluated relative to both the original small MET and HLC and for quantifying malaria vector host preferences.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nHuman landing catch, small human-baited METs (MET-SH), and large METs baited with either a human (MET-LH) or calves (MET-LC) were simultaneously used to capture wild malaria vectors outdoors in rural southern Tanzania. The four capture methods were compared in a Latin-square design over 20 nights. Malaria vector host preferences were estimated through comparison of the number of mosquitoes caught by large METs baited with either humans or cattle.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe MET-LH caught more than twice as many Anopheles arabiensis than either the MET-SH or HLC. It also caught higher number of Anopheles funestus sensu lato (s.l.) compared to the MET-SH or HLC. Similar numbers of An. funestus sensu stricto (s.s.) were caught in MET-LH and MET-SH collections. Catches of An. arabiensis with human or cattle-baited large METs were similar, indicating no clear preference for either host. In contrast, An. funestus s.s. exhibited a strong, but incomplete preference for humans.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nMETs are a sensitive, practical tool for assessing mosquito biting rates and host preferences, and represent a safer alternative to the HLC. Additionally these findings suggest the HLC underestimate whole-body human exposure. MET collections indicated the An. funestus s.s. population in this setting had a higher than expected attack rate on cattle, potentially making eliminating of this species more difficult with human-targetted control measures. Supplementary vector control tools targetted at livestock may be required to effectively tackle this species."

        "abstract": "Background\r\nPush\u2013pull strategies have been proposed as options to complement primary malaria prevention tools, indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), by targeting particularly early-night biting and outdoor-biting mosquitoes. This study evaluated different configurations of a push\u2013pull system consisting of spatial repellents [transfluthrin-treated eave ribbons (0.25 g/m2 ai)] and odour-baited traps (CO2-baited BG-Malaria traps), against indoor-biting and outdoor-biting malaria vectors inside large semi-field systems.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nTwo experimental huts were used to evaluate protective efficacy of the spatial repellents (push-only), traps (pull-only) or their combinations (push\u2013pull), relative to controls. Adult volunteers sat outdoors (1830 h\u20132200 h) catching mosquitoes attempting to bite them (outdoor-biting risk), and then went indoors (2200 h\u20130630 h) to sleep under bed nets beside which CDC-light traps caught host-seeking mosquitoes (indoor-biting risk). Number of traps and their distance from huts were varied to optimize protection, and 500 laboratory-reared Anopheles arabiensis released nightly inside the semi-field chambers over 122 experimentation nights.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nPush-pull offered higher protection than traps alone against indoor-biting (83.4% vs. 35.0%) and outdoor-biting (79% vs. 31%), but its advantage over repellents alone was non-existent against indoor-biting (83.4% vs. 81%) and modest for outdoor-biting (79% vs. 63%). Using two traps (1 per hut) offered higher protection than either one trap (0.5 per hut) or four traps (2 per hut). Compared to original distance (5 m from huts), efficacy of push\u2013pull against indoor-biting peaked when traps were 15 m away, while efficacy against outdoor-biting peaked when traps were 30 m away.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe best configuration of push\u2013pull comprised transfluthrin-treated eave ribbons plus two traps, each at least 15 m from huts. Efficacy of push\u2013pull was mainly due to the spatial repellent component. Adding odour-baited traps slightly improved personal protection indoors, but excessive trap densities increased exposure near users outdoors. Given the marginal efficacy gains over spatial repellents alone and complexity of push\u2013pull, it may be prudent to promote just spatial repellents alongside existing interventions, e.g. LLINs or non-pyrethroid IRS. However, since both transfluthrin and traps also kill mosquitoes, and because transfluthrin can inhibit blood-feeding, field studies should be done to assess potential community-level benefits that push\u2013pull or its components may offer to users and non-users."

We prospectively screened children 6\u201359 months of age, exposed and unexposed to an infectious TB case within the same household, for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\r\nMethods:\r\nWe collected medical data and clinical specimens (to evaluate for helminths, TB and HIV coinfections) and performed physical examinations at enrollment and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up surveys. LTBI was assessed using QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) at enrollment and at 3 months.\r\nResults:\r\nIn total, 301 children had complete data records (186 with TB exposure and 115 without known TB exposure). The median age of children was 26 months (range: 6\u201358); 52% were females, and 4 were HIV positive. Eight children (3%) developed TB during the 6-month follow-up. We found equal proportions of children with LTBI among those with and without exposure: 20% (38/186) versus 20% (23/115) QFT-positive, and 2% (4/186) versus 4% (5/115) indeterminate QFT. QFT conversion rate was 7% (22 children) and reversion 8% (25 children). Of the TB-exposed children, 72% initiated isoniazid preventive therapy, but 61% of parents/caregivers of children with unknown TB exposure and positive QFT refused isoniazid preventive therapy.\r\nConclusions:\r\nIn this high burden TB setting, TB exposure from sources other than the household was equally important as household exposure. Nearly one third of eligible children did not receive isoniazid preventive therapy. Evaluation for LTBI in children remains an important strategy for controlling TB but should not be limited to children with documented TB exposure"

Such knowledge can aid in the development of new malaria transmission-blocking strategies aimed at disrupting natural homeostatic processes in the mosquito during Plasmodium parasite uptake (i.e. blood feeding). The aim of this study was to understand how the An. gambiae midgut regulates oxidative stress to reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially to a potent ROS-inducer such as tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP).\r\n\r\nResults\r\nInitial studies using quantitative immunoblot indicated that the expression of the classical antioxidant protein An. gambiae thioredoxin-1 (AgTrx-1) remained unchanged across challenges with different concentrations of tBHP suggesting that additional mechanisms to regulate ROS may be involved. We therefore conducted a global proteomic survey, which revealed that An. gambiae midguts under low (50 \u03bcM) and high (200 \u03bcM) tBHP concentrations were enriched in proteins indicative of ribosomal/nucleolar stress. Ribosomal stress is an inherent cellular response to an imbalance in ribosomal proteins (RPs) due to cellular stress such as oxidative stress. Our data suggest that ribosomal/nucleolar stress is the primary cellular response in An. gambiae midguts under tBHP challenge. Considering these results, we discuss harnessing the ribosomal stress response as a potential malaria transmission-blocking strategy"

However, existing data on housing quality across Africa are limited primarily to urban areas and are mostly recorded at the national level. Here we quantify changes in housing in sub-Saharan Africa from 2000 to 2015 by combining national survey data within a geostatistical framework. We show a marked transformation of housing in urban and rural sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2015, with the prevalence of improved housing (with improved water and sanitation, sufficient living area and durable construction) doubling from 11% (95% confidence interval, 10\u201312%) to 23% (21\u201325%). However, 53 (50\u201357) million urban Africans (47% (44\u201350%) of the urban population analysed) were living in unimproved housing in 2015. We provide high-resolution, standardized estimates of housing conditions across sub-Saharan Africa.

Inextricably linked to housing quality, urban planning, education, healthcare access, and other issues of economic equity and environmental justice, the challenge of mosquito-borne diseases can only be met by linking up diverse forms of expertise and advocacy [1].\r\n\r\nLocal communities are a key actor and crucial resource in this effort. As WHO\u2019s 2017\u20132030 Global Vector Control Response reminds us, the engagement of affected communities is essential to building \u2018sustainable control programmes that are resilient in the face of technical, operational, and financial challenges\u2019 [2]. Though the form of participation will vary depending on the type of intervention, success hinges upon the degree to which citizens are effectively incorporated into the work of entomological research and mosquito abatement.\r\n\r\nA range of innovations in vector control, however, are leading us to think more deeply about how local communities and other stakeholders participate in these endeavours. On the one hand, novel technologies of mosquito modification are expanding the range of disease control options. These technologies encompass diverse forms of genetic modification, including those making use of gene drive systems, and the introduction of inheritable alterations in the mosquito\u2019s microbiome, as in the case of Wolbachia-infected strains. Depending on the particular trait incorporated into the mosquito, modified specimens can be used either to suppress the resident vector population or to replace it with a new strain that is refractory to transmission of the human pathogen. In all cases, the deployment of these technologies requires releasing laboratory-reared mosquitoes on an area-wide basis. As the history of large-scale mosquito releases suggests, the public legitimacy of this kind of intervention is always fragile\u2014doubts about the purpose of the releases and misgivings about their long-term effects have in the past triggered intense local opposition [3]. Early attempts to define robust processes of governance for novel technologies of mosquito modification have emphasised the need to engage affected communities and other relevant stakeholders well in advance of deployment in disease-endemic areas and to develop models of communication, dialogue, and education attuned to local concerns and expectations [4\u20137]."

        "abstract": "Climate change is expected to increase waterborne diseases especially in developing countries. However, we lack understanding of how different types of water sources (both improved and unimproved) are affected by climate change, and thus, where to prioritize future investments and improvements to maximize health outcomes. This is due to limited knowledge of the relationships between source water quality and the observed variability in climate conditions. To address this gap, a 20\u2010month observational study was conducted in Tanzania, aiming to understand how water quality changes at various types of sources due to short\u2010term climate variability. Nine rounds of microbiological water quality sampling were conducted for Escherichia coli and total coliforms, at three study sites within different climatic regions. Each round included approximately 233 samples from water sources and 632 samples from households. To identify relationships between water quality and short\u2010term climate variability, Bayesian hierarchical modeling was adopted, allowing these relationships to vary with source types and sampling regions to account for potentially different physical processes. Across water sources, increases in E. coli/total coliform levels were most closely related to increases in recent heavy rainfall. Our key recommendations to future longitudinal studies are (a) demonstrated value of high sampling frequency and temporal coverage (a minimum of 3 years) especially during wet seasons; (b) utility of the Bayesian hierarchical models to pool data from multiple sites while allowing for variations across space and water sources; and (c) importance of a multidisciplinary team approach with consistent commitment and sharing of knowledge.\r\n\r\nPlain Language Summary\r\nIt is vital to understand how different types of water sources (both improved and unimproved) are influenced by changing climate conditions. This is needed to appreciate the reliability of these water sources in the future. A 20\u2010month observational study was carried out in Tanzania to explore these relationships. Nine rounds of sampling were conducted across three study sites within different climatic regions, with fecal pathogen levels sampled at both water sources and households. A novel statistical model was developed to link water quality change with types of water quality and climate variability. We found that across different source types, the increases in fecal pathogen levels are most closely related to increases in recent heavy rainfall. We recommend that future studies to include at least 3 years of data collection. The successful study design here shows the value of multidisciplinary teams to ensure that appropriate statistical modeling structure can be used to analyze the data and provide new information for climate change adaptation. In the long term, such studies will provide evidence for decision\u2010makers to prioritize future water investments and improvements to maximize public health outcomes"

That is, mapping the areas where treating cattle with endectocide would potentially have the greatest impact on reducing malaria transmission. In regions of Africa that are not dominated by rainforest nor desert, the map shows a scatter of areas in several countries where this intervention shows potential, including central and eastern sub-Saharan Africa. The savanna region underneath the Sahel in West Africa appears as the climatic block that would benefit to the largest extent from this intervention, encompassing several countries. West Africa currently presents the highest under-10 malaria prevalence and elimination within the next twenty years cannot be contemplated there with currently available interventions alone, making the use of endectocide treated cattle as a complementary intervention highly appealing"

RTS,S/AS01 has completed Phase 3 clinical trials,5 received a positive opinion (Article 58) from the European Medicines Agency6 and in 2019, large-scale pilot implementation trials will be initiated in Kenya, Malawi, and Ghana to confirm the level of protective efficacy, demonstrate that the entire immunization regimen can be successfully administered, and assess several safety signals seen in the Phase 3 trial (increased meningitis, febrile seizures, and female mortality in vaccinees as compared with controls).7,8 A second pre-erthrocytic stage vaccine ChAd63 and MVA ME-TRAP has also been studied in African infants to adults.9\u201311\r\n\r\nSanaria\u00ae PfSPZ Vaccine is composed of radiation-attenuated, aseptic, purified, and cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites (SPZ).12 The vaccine has been extremely well tolerated and safe in multiple clinical trials.13\u201318 In Mali, Equatorial Guinea, and Tanzania, there was no difference in adverse events (AEs) between the PfSPZ Vaccine and normal saline (NS) control in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.18\u201320\r\n\r\nPfSPZ Vaccine has been reported in malaria-na\u00efve adults to have a vaccine efficacy (VE) of > 90% against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with homologous Pf parasites (same Pf strain in vaccine and CHMI),14,16 80% against CHMI with heterologous Pf parasites (different Pf strain in vaccine and CHMI) 3 weeks after the last vaccine dose,14,16 65% and 55% against homologous CHMI 24,16 and 5915 weeks and 54% against heterologous CHMI 33 weeks after the last vaccine dose.17 In Malian adults, VE against Pf infection during the 24 weeks after last vaccine dose was 52% by time to infection analysis and 29% by proportional analysis.18 Protection by immunization with sporozoites is dependent on T cells in mice and nonhuman primates13,21\u201324 and thought to be T cell\u2013dependent in humans.13 The durable protection demonstrated in the Mali trial was associated with elevated gamma delta T-cell frequencies, providing support for this hypothesis.25\r\n\r\nHowever, in Tanzanian adults, five doses of 2.7 \u00d7 106 PfSPZ had a VE against 3- and 24-week homologous CHMI of 20%.20 This was the same immunization regimen used in the Mali trial that gave 52% VE and in a trial in the United States that gave 92% and 65% VE against 3- and 24-week homologous CHMI.16 In Tanzania, the antibody and T-cell responses to PfSPZ in adults were significantly lower than in adults in the United States20; antibody responses in Mali were even lower.18 We hypothesized that the lower immune responses in malaria-exposed African subjects as compared with malaria-na\u00efve U.S. subjects were due to immune dysregulation caused by long-term exposure to malaria parasites18,20 and that naturally acquired immunity may have reduced the effective PfSPZ inoculum. We, therefore, proposed that injecting larger doses of PfSPZ might partially overcome these effects. This is in part because when humans are immunized with radiation-attenuated PfSPZ administered by mosquito bite,26 PfSPZ Vaccine14,15,17,27 and PfSPZ-CVac27 protection is dose dependent.26 Thus, increasing immune responses by increasing the dose should increase VE. Thus, in this study, we increased the dose of PfSPZ Vaccine from 2.7 \u00d7 105 PfSPZ to 9.0 \u00d7 105 PfSPZ and 1.8 \u00d7 106 PfSPZ.\r\n\r\nAll previous studies of PfSPZ Vaccine have been conducted in adults. However, the major burden of malaria is in older infants and children. The present study was the first to assess the tolerability, safety, and immunogenicity of PfSPZ Vaccine in adolescents, children, and infants aged 6 months and older and the first to compare these results with those of adults. Furthermore, we hypothesized that infants and young children with little previous exposure to Pf parasites would have more robust immune responses to the vaccine than adults, recognizing that the infants\u2019 immunological systems might not be fully mature, particularly for T-cell responses.28"

A cross-sectional study of maternal\u2013infant pairs at 3 months postpartum.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nAll infant total, n-3, n-6, and individual PUFA levels were correlated with maternal levels. Infant plasma n-3 PUFA levels were higher when maternal n-3 PUFA levels were higher (mean difference in infant % fatty acid per unit increase in maternal levels\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error: 0.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08; P\u2009<\u20090.01). Infant plasma docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels were positively associated with maternal DHA levels (0.77\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09; P\u2009<\u20090.01) but were lower for twin births (\u22120.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.27; P\u2009=\u20090.03). Greater birth weight in kilograms (1.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.43; P\u2009=\u20090.02) and higher maternal n-6 PUFA levels (0.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07; P\u2009<\u20090.01) were positively associated with higher infant n-6 PUFA levels, whereas maternal mono-unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) levels (\u22120.26\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08; P\u2009<\u20090.01), maternal mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) (\u22120.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11; P\u2009=\u20090.04), and male sex (\u22120.99\u2009\u00b1\u20090.45; P\u2009=\u20090.03) were associated with lower infant plasma n-6 PUFA levels. Infant plasma arachidonic acid (AA) levels were positively associated with maternal plasma AA levels (0.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09; P\u2009<\u20090.01), but inversely associated with twin births (\u22121.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.67; P\u2009=\u20090.04).\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nGreater birth weight and higher maternal plasma PUFA levels at 3 months postpartum were significantly associated with higher infant plasma PUFA levels at 3 months age. Twin births, male sex, and higher maternal MUFA levels were associated with lower infant plasma PUFA levels.

        "abstract": "Background\r\nInsecticide-treated net (ITN) durability, measured through physical integrity and bioefficacy, must be accurately assessed in order to plan the timely replacement of worn out nets and guide procurement of longer-lasting, cost-effective nets. World Health Organization (WHO) guidance advises that new intervention class ITNs be assessed 3 years after distribution, in experimental huts. In order to obtain information on whole-net efficacy cost-effectively and with adequate replication, a new bioassay, the Ifakara Ambient Chamber Test (I-ACT), a semi-field whole net assay baited with human host, was compared to established WHO durability testing methods.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nTwo experiments were conducted using pyrethroid-susceptible female adult Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto comparing bioefficacy of Olyset\u00ae, PermaNet\u00ae 2.0 and NetProtect\u00ae evaluated by I-ACT and WHO cone and tunnel tests. In total, 432 nets (144/brand) were evaluated using I-ACT and cone test. Olyset\u00ae nets (132/144) that did not meet the WHO cone test threshold criteria (\u2265\u200980% mortality or \u2265\u200995% knockdown) were evaluated using tunnel tests with threshold criteria of \u2265\u200980% mortality or \u2265\u200990% feeding inhibition for WHO tunnel and I-ACT. Pass rate of nets tested by WHO combined standard WHO bioassays (cone/tunnel tests) was compared to pass in I-ACT only by net brand and time after distribution.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nOverall, more nets passed WHO threshold criteria when tested with I-ACT than with standard WHO bioassays 92% vs 69%, (OR: 4.1, 95% CI 3.5\u20134.7, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The proportion of Olyset\u00ae nets that passed differed if WHO 2005 or WHO 2013 LN testing guidelines were followed: 77% vs 71%, respectively. Based on I-ACT results, PermaNet\u00ae 2.0 and NetProtect\u00ae demonstrated superior mortality and non-inferior feeding inhibition to Olyset\u00ae over 3 years of field use in Tanzania.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nIfakara Ambient Chamber Test may have use for durability studies and non-inferiority testing of new ITN products. It measures composite bioefficacy and physical integrity with both mortality and feeding inhibition endpoints, using fewer mosquitoes than standard WHO bioassays (cone and tunnel tests). The I-ACT is a high-throughput assay to evaluate ITN products that work through either contact toxicity or feeding inhibition. I-ACT allows mosquitoes to interact with a host sleeping underneath a net as encountered in the field, without risk to human participants"

        "abstract": "Introduction\r\nIncreased mobile phone subscribership in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) provides novel opportunities to track population health. The objective of this study was to examine reliability of data in comparing participant responses collected using two mobile phone survey (MPS) delivery modalities, computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and interactive voice response (IVR) in Bangladesh (BGD) and Tanzania (TZA).\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nUsing a cross-over design, we used random digit dialing (RDD) to call randomly generated mobile phone numbers and recruit survey participants to receive either a CATI or IVR survey on non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factors, followed 7 days later by the survey mode not received during first contact; either IVR or CATI. Respondents who received the first survey were designated as first contact (FC) and those who consented to being called a second time and subsequently answered the call were designated as follow-up (FU). We used the same questionnaire for both contacts, with response options modified to suit the delivery mode. Reliability of responses was analyzed using the Cohen\u2019s kappa statistic for percent agreement between two modes.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nSelf-reported data on demographic characteristics and NCD behavioral risk factors were collected from 482 (CATI-FC) and 653 (IVR-FC) age-eligible and consenting respondents in BGD, and from 387 (CATI-FC) and 674 (IVR-FC) respondents in TZA respectively. Survey follow-up rates were 30.7% (n = 482) for IVR-FU and 53.8% (n = 653) for CATI-FU in BGD; and 42.4% (n = 387) for IVR-FU and 49.9% (n = 674) for CATI-FU in TZA respectively. Overall, there was high consistency between delivery modalities for alcohol consumption in the past 30 days in both countries (kappa = 0.64 for CATI\u2192IVR (BGD), kappa = 0.54 for IVR\u2192CATI (BGD); kappa = 0.66 for CATI\u2192IVR (TZA), kappa = 0.76 for IVR\u2192CATI (TZA)), and current smoking (kappa = 0.68 for CATI\u2192IVR (BGD), kappa = 0.69 for IVR\u2192CATI (BGD); kappa = 0.39 for CATI\u2192IVR (TZA), kappa = 0.50 for IVR\u2192CATI (TZA)). There was moderate to substantial consistency in both countries for history of checking for hypertension and diabetes with kappa statistics ranging from 0.43 to 0.67. There was generally lower consistency in both countries for physical activity (vigorous and moderate) with kappa statistics ranging from 0.10 to 0.41, weekly fruit and vegetable with kappa ranging from 0.08 to 0.45, consumption of foods high in salt and efforts to limit salt with kappa generally below 0.3.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThe study found that when respondents are re-interviewed, the reliability of answers to most demographic and NCD variables is similar whether starting with CATI or IVR. The study underscores the need for caution when selecting questions for mobile phone surveys. Careful design can help ensure clarity of questions to minimize cognitive burden for respondents, many of whom may not have prior experience in taking automated surveys. Further research should explore possible differences and determinants of survey reliability between delivery modes and ideally compare both IVR and CATI surveys to in-person face-to-face interviews. In addition, research is needed to better understand factors that influence survey cooperation, completion, refusal and attrition rates across populations and contexts"

        "abstract": "Background: Peers are people with lived experience of mental illness. Peer support is an established intervention in which peers offer support to others with mental illness. A large proportion of people living with severe mental illness receive no care. The care gap is largest in low- and middle-income countries, with detrimental effects on individuals and societies. The global shortage of human resources for mental health is an important driver of the care gap. Peers are an under-used resource in global mental health.\r\n\r\nObjectives: To describe rationale and methodology of an international multicentre study which will scale-up peer support for people with severe mental illness in high-, middle-, and low-income countries through mixed-methods implementation research.\r\n\r\nMethods: UPSIDES is an international community of research and practice for peer support, including peer support workers, mental health researchers, and other relevant stakeholders in eight study sites across six countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia. During the first two years of UPSIDES, a series of qualitative studies and systematic reviews will explore stakeholders\u2019 perceptions and the current state of peer support at each site. Findings will be incorporated into a conceptual framework to guide the development of a culturally appropriate peer support intervention to be piloted across all study sites. All intervention and study materials will be translated according to internationally recognised guidelines.\r\n\r\nExpected Impact: UPSIDES: will leverage the unique expertise of people with lived experience of mental illness to strengthen mental health systems in high-, middle- and low-income countries. UPSIDES will actively involve and empower service users and embed patient-centeredness, recovery orientation, human rights approaches, and community participation into services. The focus on capacity-building of peers may prove particularly valuable in low-resource settings in which shortages of human capital are most severe"

        "abstract": "The Lineage 2\u2013Beijing (L2\u2013Beijing) sub-lineage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has received much attention due to its high virulence, fast disease progression, and association with antibiotic resistance. Despite several reports of the recent emergence of L2\u2013Beijing in Africa, no study has investigated the evolutionary history of this sub-lineage on the continent. In this study, we used whole genome sequences of 781 L2 clinical strains from 14 geographical regions globally distributed to investigate the origins and onward spread of this lineage in Africa. Our results reveal multiple introductions of L2\u2013Beijing into Africa linked to independent bacterial populations from East- and Southeast Asia. Bayesian analyses further indicate that these introductions occurred during the past 300 years, with most of these events pre-dating the antibiotic era. Hence, the success of L2\u2013Beijing in Africa is most likely due to its hypervirulence and high transmissibility rather than drug resistance."

        "abstract": "Background\r\nHuman tuberculosis (TB) is caused by seven phylogenetic lineages of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), Lineage 1\u20137. Recent advances in rapid genotyping of MTBC based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), allow for phylogenetically robust strain classification, paving the way for defining genotype-phenotype relationships in clinical settings. Such studies have revealed that, in addition to host and environmental factors, strain variation in the MTBC influences the outcome of TB infection and disease. In Tanzania, such molecular epidemiological studies of TB however are scarce in spite of a high TB burden.\r\n\r\nMethods and findings\r\nHere we used SNP-typing to characterize a nationwide collection of 2,039 MTBC clinical isolates representative of 1.6% of all new and retreatment TB cases notified in Tanzania during 2012 and 2013. Four lineages, namely Lineage 1\u20134 were identified within the study population. The distribution and frequency of these lineages varied across regions but overall, Lineage 4 was the most frequent (n = 866, 42.5%), followed by Lineage 3 (n = 681, 33.4%) and 1 (n = 336, 16.5%), with Lineage 2 being the least frequent (n = 92, 4.5%). We found Lineage 2 to be independently associated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.14; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.31 \u2013 3.50, p = 0.002) and retreatment cases (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 0.95 \u2013 2.84, p = 0. 065) in the study population. We found no associations between MTBC lineage and patient age or HIV status. Our sublineage typing based on spacer oligotyping on a subset of Lineage 1, 3 and 4 strains revealed the presence of mainly EAI, CAS and LAM families. Finally, we detected low levels of multidrug resistant isolates among a subset of 144 retreatment cases.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThis study provides novel insights into the MTBC lineages and the possible influence of pathogen\u2013related factors on the TB epidemic in Tanzania."

        "abstract": "Background\r\nMalaria is endemic in Tanzania with majority of clinical cases caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Additionally, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale spp. are also present and clinical manifestations caused by these infections are not well described. Clinical episodes caused by P. malariae infections are often characterized by a relatively mild illness with a low number of parasites, which can persist for long periods. In this report, two cases of P. malariae infections that were identified during a clinical trial evaluating the P. falciparum malaria vaccine candidate, PfSPZ Vaccine are described. The two participants were followed up and monitored for clinical and laboratory parameters to assess vaccine safety providing the opportunity to study clinical manifestations of P. malariae over 4 months.\r\n\r\nCase presentation\r\nTwo young, healthy Tanzanian men infected with low density asexual blood stage P. malariae diagnosed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) are described. Retrospective analysis of collected and stored blood samples revealed that the two volunteers had constant asexual blood stage parasitaemia for more than 4 months. During the 132 days of infection, the volunteers\u2019 vital signs, body temperature and serum biochemistry all remained within normal ranges. Haematological abnormalities, which were transiently outside normal ranges, were regarded as not clinically significant. During this time period, four consecutive evaluations of blood samples by thick blood smear microscopy conducted by an experienced microscopist were all negative, indicating the presence of low-density sub-microscopic infections.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThe two cases of P. malariae infections presented here confirm the ability of this Plasmodium species to persist at low density in the human host for extended time periods without causing clinical symptoms. The presented data also demonstrate that clinical study sites in malaria endemic regions need to have a strong malaria diagnostic infrastructure, including the ability of capturing sub-microscopic parasitaemia and differentiation of Plasmodium species.\r\n\r\nTrial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02613520, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02613520, Registered: November 24th 2015, Enrolment of the first participant to the trial: December 15th 2015, Trial was registered before the first participant was enrolled"

In search for reasons for the persistently high mortality rates, we explored illness recognition, decision-making and care-seeking for cases of maternal and neonatal illness and death.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nWe conducted 48 in-depth interviews (16 participants who experienced maternal illnesses, 16 mothers whose newborns experienced illness, eight mothers whose newborns died, and eight family members of a household with a maternal death), and five focus group discussions with community leaders in two districts of Mtwara region. Thematic analysis was used for interpretation of findings.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nOur data indicated relatively timely illness recognition and decision-making for maternal complications. In contrast, families reported difficulties interpreting newborn illnesses. Decisions on care-seeking involved both the mother and her partner or other family members. Delays in care-seeking were therefore also reported in absence of the husband, or at night. Primary-level facilities were first consulted. Most respondents had to consult more than one facility and described difficulties accessing and receiving appropriate care. Definitive treatment for maternal and newborn complications was largely only available in hospitals.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nDelays in reaching a facility that can provide appropriate care is influenced by multiple referrals from one facility to another. Referral and care-seeking advice should include direct care-seeking at hospitals in case of severe complications and primary facilities should facilitate prompt referral."

However, existing data on housing quality across Africa are limited primarily to urban areas and are mostly recorded at the national level. Here we quantify changes in housing in sub-Saharan Africa from 2000 to 2015 by combining national survey data within a geostatistical framework. We show a marked transformation of housing in urban and rural sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2015, with the prevalence of improved housing (with improved water and sanitation, sufficient living area and durable construction) doubling from 11% (95% confidence interval, 10\u201312%) to 23% (21\u201325%). However, 53 (50\u201357) million urban Africans (47% (44\u201350%) of the urban population analysed) were living in unimproved housing in 2015. We provide high-resolution, standardized estimates of housing conditions across sub-Saharan Africa.

There are limited data on the burden of ND in Tanzania due to insufficient coverage of civil and vital registration systems.\r\n\r\nObjectives: This study was conducted to estimate mortality of ND in all ages in Tanzania using data from the Sample Vital Registration with Verbal Autopsy (SAVVY) study.\r\n\r\nMethods: Multistage random sampling was employed to select 23 districts, 1397 census enumeration areas and 154,603 households. During the baseline survey conducted between 2011 and 2014, deaths which occurred 12 months prior to the baseline survey were documented followed by verbal autopsy interviews. Causes of death were certified using International Classification of Diseases.\r\n\r\nResults: The baseline survey enrolled a total of 650,864 residents. A total of 6645 deaths were reported to have occurred 12 months before the date of survey. Death certification was available for 5225 (79%) deaths. The leading causes of death were cerebrovascular diseases with a cause-specific mortality fraction (CSMF) of 1.64% (95% CI: 1.30\u20131.99) and 3.82% (95% CI: 2.92\u20134.72) in all ages and adults older than 50 years, respectively. Stroke accounted for 92% of all cerebrovascular deaths. Mortality of epilepsy was estimated with a CSMF of 0.94% (95% CI: 0.68\u20131.20); meningitis with a CSMF of 0.80% (95% CI: 0.56\u20131.04); cerebral palsy and other paralytic syndromes with a CSMF of 0.46% (95% CI: 0.27\u20130.65); and intrauterine hypoxia in neonates with a CSMF of 2.06% (95% CI: 1.12\u20133.01). Overall, mortality of ND was estimated with a CSMF of 4.99% (95% CI: 4.40\u20135.58).\r\n\r\nConclusions: The SAVVY survey provides estimates of mortality burden of ND in Tanzania. The study provides a basis for monitoring trends of ND and contributes to advancing knowledge of the burden of diseases. Integrating morbidities measures into the SAVVY design will provide comprehensive measures of burden of ND taking into account lifetime disabilities created by ND.\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: Cerebrovascular, epilepsy, meningitis, cerebral palsy, intrauterine hypoxia"

        "abstract": "Background\r\nAutodissemination of pyriproxyfen (PPF), i.e. co-opting adult female mosquitoes to transfer the insect growth regulator, pyriproxyfen (PPF) to their aquatic habitats has been demonstrated for Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes. This approach, could potentially enable high coverage of aquatic mosquito habitats, including those hard to locate or reach via conventional larviciding. This study demonstrated impacts of autodissemination in crashing a stable and self-sustaining population of the malaria vector, Anopheles arabiensis under semi-field conditions in Tanzania.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nSelf-propagating populations of An. arabiensis were established inside large semi-field cages. Larvae fed on naturally occurring food in 20 aquatic habitats in two study chambers (9.6\u2009\u00d7\u20099.6 m each), while emerging adults fed on tethered cattle. The mosquito population was monitored using emergence traps and human landing catches, each time returning captured adults into the chambers. Once the population was stable (after 23 filial generations), PPF dissemination devices (i.e. four clay pots each treated with 0.2\u20130.3 g PPF) were introduced into one of the chambers (treatment) and their impact monitored in parallel with untreated chamber (control).\r\n\r\nResults\r\nDaily adult emergence was similar between control and treatment chambers, with average (\u00b1\u2009SE) of 14.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.70 and 12.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.74 mosquitoes/trap, respectively, before treatment. Three months post-treatment, mean number of adult An. arabiensis emerging from the habitats was 5.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.42 in control and 0.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04 in treatment chambers. This was equivalent to >\u200997% suppression in treatment chamber without re-treatment of the clay pots. Similarly, the number of mosquitoes attempting to bite volunteers inside the treatment chamber decreased to zero, 6 months post-exposure (i.e. 100% suppression). In contrast, biting rates in control rose to 53.75\u2009\u00b1\u20093.07 per volunteer over the same period.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThese findings demonstrate effective suppression of stable populations of malaria vectors using a small number of simple autodissemination devices, from which adult mosquitoes propagated pyriproxyfen to contaminate aquatic habitats in the system. This is the first proof that autodissemination can amplify treatment coverage and deplete malaria vector populations. Field trials are necessary to validate these results, and assess impact of autodissemination as a complementary malaria intervention."

        "abstract": "Background\r\nThe propensity of different Anopheles mosquitoes to bite humans instead of other vertebrates influences their capacity to transmit pathogens to humans. Unfortunately, determining proportions of mosquitoes that have fed on humans, i.e. Human Blood Index (HBI), currently requires expensive and time-consuming laboratory procedures involving enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or polymerase chain reactions (PCR). Here, mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy and supervised machine learning are used to accurately distinguish between vertebrate blood meals in guts of malaria mosquitoes, without any molecular techniques.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nLaboratory-reared Anopheles arabiensis females were fed on humans, chickens, goats or bovines, then held for 6 to 8 h, after which they were killed and preserved in silica. The sample size was 2000 mosquitoes (500 per host species). Five individuals of each host species were enrolled to ensure genotype variability, and 100 mosquitoes fed on each. Dried mosquito abdomens were individually scanned using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometer to obtain high-resolution MIR spectra (4000 cm\u22121 to 400 cm\u22121). The spectral data were cleaned to compensate atmospheric water and CO2 interference bands using Bruker-OPUS software, then transferred to Python\u2122 for supervised machine-learning to predict host species. Seven classification algorithms were trained using 90% of the spectra through several combinations of 75\u201325% data splits. The best performing model was used to predict identities of the remaining 10% validation spectra, which had not been used for model training or testing.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe logistic regression (LR) model achieved the highest accuracy, correctly predicting true vertebrate blood meal sources with overall accuracy of 98.4%. The model correctly identified 96% goat blood meals, 97% of bovine blood meals, 100% of chicken blood meals and 100% of human blood meals. Three percent of bovine blood meals were misclassified as goat, and 2% of goat blood meals misclassified as human.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nMid-infrared spectroscopy coupled with supervised machine learning can accurately identify multiple vertebrate blood meals in malaria vectors, thus potentially enabling rapid assessment of mosquito blood-feeding histories and vectorial capacities. The technique is cost-effective, fast, simple, and requires no reagents other than desiccants. However, scaling it up will require field validation of the findings and boosting relevant technical capacity in affected countries.\r\n\r\nBackground"

Tanzania has the fifth highest incidence of SCD (with an estimated 11 000 SCD annual births) worldwide. Although newborn screening (NBS) for SCD and comprehensive healthcare have been shown to reduce under-5 mortality by up to 94% in high-income countries such as the USA, no country in Africa has maintained NBS for SCD as a national health program. The aims of this program were to establish and evaluate NBS-SCD as a health intervention in Tanzania and to determine the birth prevalence of SCD.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nMuhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences conducted NBS for SCD from January 2015 to November 2016. Dried blood spot samples were collected and tested for SCD using isoelectric focusing.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nScreening was conducted on 3981 newborns. Thirty-one (0.8%) babies had SCD, 505 (12.6%) had sickle cell trait and 26 (0.7%) had other hemoglobinopathies. Twenty-eight (90.3%) of the 31 newborns with SCD were enrolled for comprehensive healthcare.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThis is the first report on NBS as a health program for SCD in Tanzania. The SCD birth prevalence of 8 per 1000 births is of public health significance. It is therefore important to conduct NBS for SCD with enrollment into a comprehensive care program."

We found that sTREM-1 was the best prognostic marker for 28-day mortality (area under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81\u20130.92) and was significantly better than CRP (P < .0001) and PCT (P = .0001). The prognostic accuracy of qSOFA and the GCS were significantly enhanced when sTREM-1 was added (0.80 [95% CI 0.76\u20130.83] to 0.91 [95% CI 0.88\u20130.94; P < .05] and 0.72 [95% CI 0.63\u20130.80] to 0.94 [95% CI 0.91\u20130.97; P < .05], respectively).\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nMeasuring sTREM-1 at clinical presentation can identify febrile individuals at risk of all-cause febrile mortality. Adding severity markers such as sTREM-1 to simple clinical scores could improve the recognition and triage of patients with life-threatening infections in resource-limited settings."

What barriers do caregivers face when they decide to seek care and what challenges might an increasingly capable but complex health system pose for them?\r\n\r\nThese questions may best be answered by viewing healthcare-seeking pathways and the health system from the perspective of its users, an area of scholarship that is poorly represented in the literature in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC).10 This study aims to address the gap in knowledge by analysing verbal and social autopsy (VSA) data collected following all deaths of children aged 1\u20135 years in two rural districts in Rwanda."

        "abstract": "To accelerate malaria elimination in areas where core interventions such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are already widely used, it is crucial to consider additional factors associated with persistent transmission. Qualitative data on human behaviours and perceptions regarding malaria risk was triangulated with quantitative data on Anopheles mosquito bites occurring indoors and outdoors in south-eastern Tanzania communities where ITNS are already used but lower level malaria transmission persists. Each night (18:00h-07:00h), trained residents recorded human activities indoors, in peri-domestic outdoor areas, and in communal gatherings. Host-seeking mosquitoes were repeatedly collected indoors and outdoors hourly, using miniaturized exposure-free double net traps (DN-Mini) occupied by volunteers. In-depth interviews were conducted with household representatives to explore perceptions on persistent malaria and its control. Higher proportions of people stayed outdoors than indoors in early-evening and early-morning hours, resulting in higher exposures outdoors than indoors during these times. However, exposure during late-night hours (22:00h\u201305:00h) occurred mostly indoors. Some of the popular activities that kept people outdoors included cooking, eating, relaxing and playing. All households had at least one bed net, and 83.9% of people had access to ITNs. Average ITN use was 96.3%, preventing most indoor exposure. Participants recorgnized the importance of ITNs but also noted that the nets were not perfect. No complementary interventions were reported being used widely. Most people believed transmission happens after midnight. We conclude that insecticide-treated nets, where properly used, can still prevent most indoor exposures, but significant risk continues unabated before bedtime, outdoors and at communal gatherings. Such exposure is greatest for rural and low-income households. There is therefore an urgent need for complementary interventions, particularly those targeting outdoor-biting and are applicable for all people including the marginalised populations such as migratory farmers and fishermen. Besides, the differences in community understanding of ongoing transmission, and feedback on imperfections of ITNs should be considered when updating malaria-related communication and interventions."

Despite the central role of Tfh cells in vaccine responses, there is currently no validated way to enhance their differentiation in humans. From paired human lymph node and blood samples, we identify a population of circulating Tfh cells that are transcriptionally and clonally similar to germinal center Tfh cells. In a clinical trial of vaccine formulations, circulating Tfh cells were expanded in Tanzanian volunteers when an experimental malaria vaccine was adjuvanted in GLA-SE but not when formulated in Alum. The GLA-SE\u2013formulated peptide was associated with an increase in the extrafollicular antibody response, long-lived antibody production, and the emergence of public TCR\u03b2 clonotypes in circulating Tfh cells. We demonstrate that altering vaccine adjuvants is a rational approach for enhancing Tfh cells in humans, thereby supporting the long-lived humoral immunity that is required for effective vaccines"

The aim of this systematic review was to identify influences which facilitate or are barriers to implementation of mental health peer support work.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nData sources comprised online databases (n\u2009=\u200911), journal table of contents (n\u2009=\u20092), conference proceedings (n\u2009=\u200918), peer support websites (n\u2009=\u20092), expert consultation (n\u2009=\u200938) and forward and backward citation tracking. Publications were included if they reported on implementation facilitators or barriers for formal face-to-face peer support work with adults with a mental health problem, and were available in English, French, German, Hebrew, Luganda, Spanish or Swahili. Data were analysed using narrative synthesis. A six-site international survey [Germany (2 sites), India, Israel, Tanzania, Uganda] using a measure based on the strongest influences was conducted. The review protocol was pre-registered (Prospero: CRD42018094838).\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe search strategy identified 5813 publications, of which 53 were included. Fourteen implementation influences were identified, notably organisational culture (reported by 53% of papers), training (42%) and role definition (40%). Ratings on a measure using these influences demonstrated preliminary evidence for the convergent and discriminant validity of the identified influences.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe identified influences provide a guide to implementation of peer support. For services developing a peer support service, organisational culture including role support (training, role clarity, resourcing and access to a peer network) and staff attitudes need to be considered. The identified influences provide a theory base to prepare research sites for implementing peer support worker interventions.\r\n\r\nKeywords\r\nPeer support Consumer\u2013provider Mental health Systematic review Implementation"

        "abstract": "We thank Mathieu Maheu-Giroux and Marcia Castro for their Correspondence about our Article.1 Regarding concerns about the stepped-wedge design of the larviciding scale-up in our study, we agree and also note that scale-up was not randomised, but rather introduced earliest to the best-prepared wards. However, such compromises are normal and healthy in pragmatic assessments of effectiveness under realistic programmatic conditions, rather than efficacy under artificially controlled experimental conditions. As acknowledged in the discussion and emphasised in the title, we also agree that evidence for window screening impact is purely observational, and that long-overdue, cluster-randomised, experimentally controlled analyses of well developed delivery practices for both these supplementary vector control measures are urgently needed.1\r\n\r\nHowever, we disagree with the view that our attributions of intervention effects are haphazard and that potential confounders were \u201carbitrarily disregarded\u201d. In our Article,1 factors such as bed nets, antimalarial drugs, and household-level screening were all considered in the analysis, with relevant effect sizes reported and discussed in detail. Although major shifts in vector population composition were observed in rural Tanzania around the time of the first mass distributions for insecticide-treated nets in 2008,2, 3 no equivalent changes were observed in Dar es Salaam over the same period, because the city was given lowest priority in both national campaigns so coverage remained low until 2010.4 Although a slight upward trend in net usage coincided with the downward trend in human malaria prevalence in Dar es Salaam, and artemisinin-based therapies also came into use, uptake of both measures was far too low to plausibly account for such massive reductions of malaria burden.1\r\n\r\nThe only interventions for which substantive upward coverage trends were observed over the study period were larviciding and window screening. Together, these two intervention scale-ups were associated with prevalence reductions equivalent to those accounted for with a simple, unattributed empirical time trend.1 As detailed in the methods, we did account for temporal autocorrelation when fitting these models.1 Indeed, our models that included a simple empirical time trend as per previous studies5, 6 essentially reproduced the previous results, notably the modest effect size estimates for larviciding. The major issue therefore seems to be that fitting an unattributed empirical time trend may have spuriously assimilated the effects of both observed intervention scale-up processes.1 Underestimating effect sizes may be as dangerous as overestimating them, and regression dilution bias inherently exacerbates risk of underestimation.\r\n\r\nNotably, the entomological secondary outcomes and explanatory variables clearly and independently implicated window screening as the most important, obvious, and parsimonious explanation for the remarkable decline in malaria prevalence.1 Substantial reductions of mosquito population density were associated with scale-up of both larviciding and window screens. Effect sizes for different taxonomic groups of mosquitoes were fully consistent with those attributed to the same two interventions for the epidemiological data. Crucially, the effect sizes for window screening were greatest for the most efficient malaria vectors with the greatest preference for human hosts, and therefore the greatest dependence upon accessing human blood. It is difficult to envision how changes in demography, socioeconomic status, or any intervention other than a personal protection measure like window screens could cause such behaviour-dependent effects on mosquito populations.\r\n\r\nGFK, NJG, YPM, and PPC report grants from the United States Agency for International Development, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust (fellowship award to GFK), and Valent BioSciences LLC"

        "abstract": "Background\r\nIntermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) is a highly-recommended intervention to prevent maternal and neonatal complications associated with malaria infection. Despite fairly high antenatal care (ANC) coverage in Tanzania, low IPTp uptake rates represent a gap in efforts to decrease complications attributed to malaria in pregnancy. The objective of this study was to examine if availability, readiness and managing authority are associated with uptake of IPTp during ANC.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nData for this analysis come from a cross-sectional survey, the Tanzania Service Provision Assessment conducted between 2014 and 2015. Principal component analysis was used to create scores for availability of malaria services and readiness for the provision of services. Generalized estimating equation models with logit link and the binomial distribution assessed factors that impact the uptake of IPTp by pregnant women attending ANC.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nHigher fraction of women in their third trimester than second (68% versus 49%, OR\u2009=\u20092.6; 95% CI (2.1\u20133.3)), had received at least one dose of IPTp. There was a wide variation in the availability and readiness of malaria services provision and diagnostic tools by managing authorities. Public facilities were more likely than private to offer malaria rapid diagnostic test, and more providers at public facilities than private diagnosed and/or treated malaria. Women who attended facilities where direct observation therapy was practiced were more likely to have received at least one dose of IPTp (64% versus 46% who received none; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Women who attended ANC at a facility with a high readiness score were more likely to take IPTp than those attending facilities with low readiness scores (OR\u2009=\u20092.1; 95% CI (1.4\u20133.3)). Reported stock out on the day of interview was negatively associated with IPTp uptake (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.07\u20130.1).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nReadiness of health facilities to provide malaria related services, the number of ANC visits and gestational age were associated with uptake of IPTp among women attending ANC. There are disparities in malaria service availability and readiness across geographical location and managing authorities. These findings could be used to assist the malaria programme and policymakers to appropriately decide when planning for malaria service deliveries and interventions."

We used three high-resolution infrared cameras (68 frames/second) to track flight behaviors of laboratory-reared Anopheles arabiensis females in vicinity of the BGM in comparison with BGS. Additional comparisons were done for BGM at 20, 40 and 80cm heights, and for BGMs baited with Ifakara blend plus CO2, CO2 alone, or no bait. More mosquitoes were observed near BGM than BGS. Both BGMs installed 20cm above the floor and baited with CO2 received more visits by host-seeking mosquitoes than the other BGMs evaluated in their respective experiments. Trap designs, height and attractants all influence mosquito activity in vicinity of the traps which can be readily visualized using infrared cameras to accelerate trap development and testing. The greater activity of host-seeking mosquitoes near BGM than BGS supports the proven superiority of BGM traps in field and semi-field settings"

        "abstract": "Background\r\nThis paper reports on a rigorously designed non-masked randomized cluster trial of the childhood survival impact of deploying paid community health workers to provide doorstep preventive, promotional, and curative antenatal, newborn, child, and reproductive health care in three rural Tanzanian districts.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nFrom August, 2011 to June 2015 ongoing demographic surveillance on 380,000 individuals permitted monitoring of neonatal, infant and under-5 mortality rates for 50 randomly selected intervention and 51 comparison villages. Over the initial 2 years of the project, logistics and supply support systems were managed by the Ifakara Health Institute. In 2013, the experiment transitioned its operational design to logistical support managed by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare with the goal of enhancing government operational ownership and utilization of results for policy.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe baseline under 5 mortality rate was 81.3 deaths per 1000 live births with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 77.2\u201385.6 in the intervention group and 82.7/1000 (95% CI 78.5\u201387.1) in the comparison group yielding an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.99 (95% CI 0.88\u20131.11, p =\u20090.867). After 4 years of implementation, the under 5 mortality rate was 73.2/1000 (95% CI 69.3\u201377.3) in the intervention group and 77.4/1000 (95% CI 73.8\u201381.1) in the comparison group (adjusted HR 0.95 [95% CI 0.86\u20131.07], p =\u20090.443). The intervention had no impact on neonatal mortality in either the first 2 years (HR 1.10 [95% CI 0.89\u20131.36], p =\u2009.392) or last 2 years of implementation (HR 0.98 [95% CI 0.74\u20131.30], p =\u2009.902). Although community health worker deployment significantly reduced mortality among children aged 1\u201359\u2009months during the first 2 years of implementation (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.76\u20130.96], p =\u20090.008), mortality among post neonates was the same in both groups in years three and four (HR 1.03 [95% CI 0.85\u20131.24], p =\u20090.772). Results adjusted for stock-out effects show that diminishing impact was associated with logistics system lapses that constrained worker access to essential drugs and increased post-neonatal mortality risk in the final two project years (HR 1.42 [95% CI 1\u00b707\u20131\u00b788], p\u2009=\u20090\u00b7015).\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nCommunity health worker home-visit deployment had a null effect among neonates, and 2 years of initial impact among children over 1 month of age, but a null effect when tests were based on over 1 month of age data merged for all four project years. The atrophy of under age five effects arose because workers were not continuously equipped with essential medicines in years three and four. Analyses that controlled for stock-out effects suggest that adequately supplied workers had survival effects on children aged 1 to 59\u2009months."

        "abstract": "Background\r\nZanzibar has maintained malaria prevalence below 1% for the past decade, yet elimination remains elusive despite high coverage of core vector control interventions. As part of a study investigating the magnitude and drivers of residual transmission in Zanzibar, qualitative methods were utilized to better understand night time activities and sleeping patterns, individual and community-level risk perceptions, and malaria prevention practices.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nA total of 62 in-depth interviews were conducted with community members and local leaders across six sites on Unguja Island, Zanzibar. Twenty semi-structured community observations of night-time activities and special events were conducted to complement interview findings. Data were transcribed verbatim, coded, and analysed using a thematic approach.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nParticipants reported high levels of ITN use, but noted gaps in protection, particularly when outdoors or away from home. Routine household and community activities were common in evenings before bed and early mornings, while livelihood activities and special events lasted all or most of the night. Gender variation was reported, with men routinely spending more time away from home than women and children. Outdoor sleeping was reported during special events, such as weddings, funerals, and religious ceremonies. Participants described having difficulty preventing mosquito bites while outdoors, travelling, or away from home, and perceived higher risk of malaria infection during these times. Travel and migration emerged as a crucial issue and participants viewed seasonal workers coming from mainland Tanzania as more likely to have a malaria infection and less likely to be connected to prevention and treatment services in Zanzibar. Some community leaders reported taking the initiative to register seasonal workers coming into their community and linking them to testing and treatment services.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nTargeting malaria interventions effectively is critical and should be informed by a clear understanding of relevant human behaviour. These findings highlight malaria prevention gaps in Zanzibar, and the importance of identifying new approaches to complement current interventions and accelerate the final phases of malaria elimination. Development and deployment of complementary interventions should consider human behaviour, including gender norms, that can influence exposure to malaria vectors and prevention practices. Expansion of community-level programmes targeting travellers and seasonal workers should also be explored."

Mosquito bites taken outside of these times contribute to residual transmission which determines the maximum effectiveness of current malaria prevention. The likelihood mosquitoes feed outside the time of day when LLINs and IRS can protect people is poorly understood, and the proportion of bites received outdoors may be higher after prolonged vector control. A systematic review of mosquito and human behavior is used to quantify and estimate the public health impact of outdoor biting across Africa. On average 79% of bites by the major malaria vectors occur during the time when people are in bed. This estimate is substantially lower than previous predictions, with results suggesting a nearly 10% lower proportion of bites taken at the time when people are beneath LLINs since the year 2000. Across Africa, this higher outdoor transmission is predicted to result in an estimated 10.6 million additional malaria cases annually if universal LLIN and IRS coverage was achieved. Higher outdoor biting diminishes the cases of malaria averted by vector control. This reduction in LLIN effectiveness appears to be exacerbated in areas where mosquito populations are resistant to insecticides used in bed nets, but no association was found between physiological resistance and outdoor biting. Substantial spatial heterogeneity in mosquito biting behavior between communities could contribute to differences in effectiveness of malaria control across Africa."

        "abstract": "Background\r\nNear infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is currently complementing techniques to age-grade mosquitoes. NIRS classifies lab-reared and semi-field raised mosquitoes into < or \u2265 7 days old with an average accuracy of 80%, achieved by training a regression model using partial least squares (PLS) and interpreted as a binary classifier.\r\n\r\nMethods and findings\r\nWe explore whether using an artificial neural network (ANN) analysis instead of PLS regression improves the current accuracy of NIRS models for age-grading malaria transmitting mosquitoes. We also explore if directly training a binary classifier instead of training a regression model and interpreting it as a binary classifier improves the accuracy. A total of 786 and 870 NIR spectra collected from laboratory reared An. gambiae and An. arabiensis, respectively, were used and pre-processed according to previously published protocols. The ANN regression model scored root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 for An. gambiae and 2.8 \u00b1 0.2 for An. arabiensis; whereas the PLS regression model scored RMSE of 3.7 \u00b1 0.2 for An. gambiae, and 4.5 \u00b1 0.1 for An. arabiensis. When we interpreted regression models as binary classifiers, the accuracy of the ANN regression model was 93.7 \u00b1 1.0% for An. gambiae, and 90.2 \u00b1 1.7% for An. arabiensis; while PLS regression model scored the accuracy of 83.9 \u00b1 2.3% for An. gambiae, and 80.3 \u00b1 2.1% for An. arabiensis. We also find that a directly trained binary classifier yields higher age estimation accuracy than a regression model interpreted as a binary classifier. A directly trained ANN binary classifier scored an accuracy of 99.4 \u00b1 1.0 for An. gambiae and 99.0 \u00b1 0.6% for An. arabiensis; while a directly trained PLS binary classifier scored 93.6 \u00b1 1.2% for An. gambiae and 88.7 \u00b1 1.1% for An. arabiensis. We further tested the reproducibility of these results on different independent mosquito datasets. ANNs scored higher estimation accuracies than when the same age models are trained using PLS. Regardless of the model architecture, directly trained binary classifiers scored higher accuracies on classifying age of mosquitoes than regression models translated as binary classifiers.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nWe recommend training models to estimate age of An. arabiensis and An. gambiae using ANN model architectures (especially for datasets with at least 70 mosquitoes per age group) and direct training of binary classifier instead of training a regression model and interpreting it as a binary classifier"

We found considerable variability in the decomposition rate and extent. This was compared with decomposition in the same latrines, measured by comparing top layer composition with fresh stools and deeper (older) layers, to assess whether this potential was realised in situ. Results showed a close match between the extent of organic material breakdown in situ and in vitro, indicating that anaerobic digestion is the dominant pathway in latrines. The average potential decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) (determined as methane production in vitro within 60 days) and actual measured decrease in situ are 68.9% \u00b1 11.3 and 69.7% \u00b1 19.4, respectively. However in the in vitro tests, where samples were diluted in water, full decomposition was achieved in 2 months, whereas in situ it can take years; this suggests that water addition may offer a simple route to improving latrine performance. The results also allowed us to estimate, for the first time to our knowledge using experimental data, the contribution that latrines make to greenhouse gas emissions globally. This amounts to \u223c2% of annual US emissions."

        "abstract": "Background\r\nHigh satisfaction with healthcare is common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), despite widespread quality deficits. This may be due to low expectations because people lack knowledge about what constitutes good quality or are resigned about the quality of available services.\r\n\r\nMethods and findings\r\nWe fielded an internet survey in Argentina, China, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa in 2017 (N = 17,996). It included vignettes describing poor-quality services\u2014inadequate technical or interpersonal care\u2014for 2 conditions. After applying population weights, most of our respondents lived in urban areas (59%), had finished primary school (55%), and were under the age of 50 (75%). Just over half were men (51%), and the vast majority reported that they were in good health (73%). Over half (53%) of our study population rated the quality of vignettes describing poor-quality services as good or better. We used multilevel logistic regression and found that good ratings were associated with less education (no formal schooling versus university education; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.22, 95% CI 1.90\u20132.59, P < 0.001), better self-reported health (excellent versus poor health; AOR 5.19, 95% CI 4.33\u20136.21, P < 0.001), history of discrimination in healthcare (AOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.36\u20131.57, P < 0.001), and male gender (AOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.23\u20131.41, P < 0.001). The survey did not reach nonusers of the internet thus only representing the internet-using population.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nMajorities of the internet-using public in 12 LMICs have low expectations of healthcare quality as evidenced by high ratings given to poor-quality care. Low expectations of health services likely dampen demand for quality, reduce pressure on systems to deliver quality care, and inflate satisfaction ratings. Policies and interventions to raise people\u2019s expectations of the quality of healthcare they receive should be considered in health system quality reforms."

However, little is known about the prevalence of disrespectful treatment of patients in sub-Saharan Africa outside of maternity care. We used data from a household survey of 2002 women living in rural Tanzania to describe the extent of disrespectful care during outpatient visits, who receive disrespectful care, and determine the association with patient satisfaction, rating of quality and recommendation of the facility to others. We asked about women\u2019s most recent outpatient visit to the local clinic, including if they were made to feel disrespected, if a provider shouted at or scolded them, and if providers made negative or disparaging comments about them. Women who answered yes to any of these questions were considered to have experienced disrespectful care. We report risk ratios with standard errors clustered at the facility level. The most common reasons for seeking care were fever or malaria (33.9%), vaccination (33.6%) and non-emergent check-up (13.4%). Disrespectful care was reported by 14.3% of women and was more likely if the visit was for sickness compared to a routine check-up [risk ratio (RR): 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1\u20132.2]. Women who did not report disrespectful care were 2.1 times as likely to recommend the clinic (95% CI: 1.6\u20132.7). While there is currently a lot of attention on disrespectful maternity care, our results suggest that this is a problem that goes beyond this single health issue and should be addressed by more horizontal health system interventions and policies."

        "abstract": "Background\r\nKnowledge of mosquito movement would aid the design of effective intervention strategies against malaria. However, data on mosquito movement through mark-recapture or genetics studies are challenging to collect, and so are not available for many sites. An additional source of information may come from secondary analyses of data from trials of repellents where household mosquito densities are collected. Using the study design of published trials, we developed a statistical model which can be used to estimate the movement between houses for mosquitoes displaced by a spatial repellent. The method uses information on the different distributions of mosquitoes between houses when no households are using spatial repellents compared to when there is incomplete coverage. The parameters to be estimated are the proportion of mosquitoes repelled, the proportion of those repelled that go to another house and the mean distance of movement between houses. Estimation is by maximum likelihood.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nWe evaluated the method using simulation and found that data on the seasonal pattern of mosquito densities were required, which could be additionally collected during a trial. The method was able to provide accurate estimates from simulated data, except when the setting has few mosquitoes overall, few repelled, or the coverage with spatial repellent is low. The trial that motivated our analysis was found to have too few mosquitoes caught and repelled for our method to provide accurate results.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nWe propose that the method could be used as a secondary analysis of trial data to gain estimates of mosquito movement in the presence of repellents for trials with sufficient numbers of mosquitoes caught and repelled and with coverage levels which allow sufficient numbers of houses with and without repellent. Estimates from this method may supplement those from mark-release-recapture studies, and be used in designing effective malaria intervention strategies, parameterizing mathematical models and in designing trials of vector control interventions."

In such countries, many deliveries occur at primary care facilities, where the quality of care is poor. We modeled the geographic feasibility of service delivery redesign that shifted deliveries from primary care clinics to hospitals in six countries: Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nepal, and Tanzania. We estimated the proportion of women within two hours of the nearest delivery facility, both currently and under redesign. Today, 83\u2013100 percent of pregnant women in the study countries have two-hour access to a delivery facility. A policy of redesign would reduce two-hour access by at most 10 percent, ranging from 0.6 percent in Malawi to 9.9 percent in Tanzania. Relocating delivery services to hospitals would not unduly impede geographic access to care in the study countries. This policy should be considered in low- and middle-income countries, as it may be an effective approach to reducing maternal and newborn deaths."

The Commission contends that measurement of quality should focus on the processes of care and their impacts. In addition to monitoring treatment coverage and the availability of tools, governments should consider indicators of clinical competence (for e.g. ability of providers to correctly diagnose TB and adhere to treatment guidelines), of timely, continuous and integrated care and of respectful and patient-centered care. Indicators of impact include TB mortality and treatment success rates, but also quality of life and daily functioning among TB patients, public trust in TB services, and bypassing of the formal health system for TB care. Cascades of care, from initial care seeking to recurrence-free survival, should be built in every high-burden country to monitor quality longitudinally. In turn, improvement efforts should target the foundations of health systems and consider the Commission's four universal actions: governing for quality, redesigning service delivery, transforming the health workforce and igniting demand for quality TB services. Important work remains to validate new indicators of TB care quality, develop data collection systems for new measures, and to test new strategies for improving the delivery of competent and respectful TB care"

This study measured protection afforded by transfluthrin-treated eave ribbons to users (personal and communal protection) and non-users (only communal protection), and whether introducing mosquito traps as additional intervention influenced these benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Methods</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Five experimental huts were constructed inside a 110&nbsp;m long, screened tunnel, in which 1000&nbsp;<em>Anopheles arabiensis</em>&nbsp;were released nightly. Eave ribbons treated with 0.25&nbsp;g/m2&nbsp;transfluthrin were fitted to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 huts, achieving 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% coverage, respectively. Volunteers sat near each hut and collected mosquitoes attempting to bite them from 6 to 10&nbsp;p.m. (outdoor-biting), then went indoors to sleep under untreated bed nets, beside which CDC-light traps collected mosquitoes from 10&nbsp;p.m. to 6&nbsp;a.m. (indoor-biting). Caged mosquitoes kept inside the huts were monitored for 24&nbsp;h-mortality. Separately, eave ribbons, UV&ndash;LED mosquito traps (Mosclean) or both the ribbons and traps were fitted, each time leaving the central hut unfitted to represent non-user households and assess communal protection. Biting risk was measured concurrently in all huts, before and after introducing interventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Transfluthrin-treated eave ribbons provided 83% and 62% protection indoors and outdoors respectively to users, plus 57% and 48% protection indoors and outdoors to the non-user. Protection for users remained constant, but protection for non-users increased with eave ribbons coverage, peaking once 80% of huts were fitted. Mortality of mosquitoes caged inside huts with eave ribbons was 100%. The UV&ndash;LED traps increased indoor exposure to users and non-users, but marginally reduced outdoor-biting. Combining the traps and eave ribbons did not improve user protection relative to eave ribbons alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Transfluthrin-treated eave ribbons protect both users and non-users against malaria mosquitoes indoors and outdoors. The mosquito-killing property of transfluthrin can magnify the communal benefits by limiting unwanted diversion to non-users, but should be validated in field trials against pyrethroid-resistant vectors. Benefits of the UV&ndash;LED traps as an intervention alone or alongside eave ribbons were however undetectable in this study. These findings extend the evidence that transfluthrin-treated eave ribbons could complement ITNs</p>"

        "abstract": "<p>Despite the global efforts made in the fight against malaria, the disease is resurging. One of the main causes is the resistance that&nbsp;<em>Anopheles</em>&nbsp;mosquitoes, vectors of the disease, have developed to insecticides.&nbsp;<em>Anopheles</em>&nbsp;must survive for at least 10 days to possibly transmit malaria. Therefore, to evaluate and improve malaria vector control interventions, it is imperative to monitor and accurately estimate the age distribution of mosquito populations as well as their population sizes. Here, we demonstrate a machine-learning based approach that uses mid-infrared spectra of mosquitoes to characterise simultaneously both age and species identity of females of the African malaria vector species&nbsp;<em>Anopheles gambiae</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>, using laboratory colonies. Mid-infrared spectroscopy-based prediction of mosquito age structures was statistically indistinguishable from true modelled distributions. The accuracy of classifying mosquitoes by species was 82.6%. The method has a negligible cost per mosquito, does not require highly trained personnel, is rapid, and so can be easily applied in both laboratory and field settings. Our results indicate this method is a promising alternative to current mosquito species and age-grading approaches, with further improvements to accuracy and expansion for use with wild mosquito vectors possible through collection of larger mid-infrared spectroscopy data sets.</p>"

The Commission contends that measurement of quality should focus on the processes of care and their impacts. In addition to monitoring treatment coverage and the availability of tools, governments should consider indicators of clinical competence (for e.g. ability of providers to correctly diagnose TB and adhere to treatment guidelines), of timely, continuous and integrated care and of respectful and patient-centered care. Indicators of impact include TB mortality and treatment success rates, but also quality of life and daily functioning among TB patients, public trust in TB services, and bypassing of the formal health system for TB care. Cascades of care, from initial care seeking to recurrence-free survival, should be built in every high-burden country to monitor quality longitudinally. In turn, improvement efforts should target the foundations of health systems and consider the Commission&#39;s four universal actions: governing for quality, redesigning service delivery, transforming the health workforce and igniting demand for quality TB services. Important work remains to validate new indicators of TB care quality, develop data collection systems for new measures, and to test new strategies for improving the delivery of competent and respectful TB care.</p>"

        "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Tanzania is one of many low income countries committed to universal health coverage and Sustainable Development Goals. Despite these bold goals, there is growing concern that the country could be off-track in meeting these goals. This prompted the Government of Tanzania to look for ways to improve health outcomes in these goals and this led to the introduction of Payment for Performance (P4P) in the health sector. Since the inception of P4P in Tanzania a number of impact, cost-effective and process evaluations have been published with less attention being paid to the experiences of care in this context of P4P, which we argue is important for policy agenda setting. This study therefore explores these experiences from the perspectives of health workers, service users and community health governing committee members.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Methods</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A qualitative study design was used to elicit experiences of health workers, health service users and health governing committee members in Rufiji district of the Pwani region in Tanzania. The Payment for Performance pilot was introduced in Pwani region in 2011 and data presented in this article is based on this pilot. A total of 31 in-depth interviews with health workers and 9 focus group discussions with health service users and health governing committee members were conducted. Collected data was analysed through qualitative content analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Study informants reported positive experiences with Payment for Performance and highlighted its potential in improving the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of care (AAAQ). However, the study found that persistent barriers for achieving AAAQ still exist in the health system of Tanzania and these contribute to negative experiences of care in the context of P4P.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our findings suggest that there are a number of positive aspects of care that can be improved by Payment for Performance. However its targeted nature on specific services means that these improvements cannot be generalized at health facility level. Additionally, health workers can go as far as they can in improving health services but some factors that act as barriers as demonstrated in this study are out of their control even in the context of Payment for Performance. In this regard there is need to exercise caution when implementing such initiatives, despite seemingly positive targeted outcomes.</p>"

One of the fastest growing areas is the identification of infectious diseases using molecular diagnostics, which is becoming an integral part of medical practice and public health worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/btn-2019-0064#B2\" id=\"B2R\">2</a>]. Molecular diagnostic tools, especially nucleic acid amplification techniques, provide faster, more sensitive and often more cost-effective diagnoses than traditional culture methods for microbiological analysis [<a href=\"https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/btn-2019-0064#B3\" id=\"B3R\">3</a>]. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a well-established method for the detection, quantification and typing of bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa in the areas of clinical and veterinary diagnostics, as well as food safety [<a href=\"https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/btn-2019-0064#B4\" id=\"B4R\">4</a>]. Among the biggest advantages of qPCR-based diagnosis are the universality in designing and developing new assays as well as the widespread availability of the technology. Moreover, qPCR also allows quantification and genotyping of pathogens. With the rapid spread of qPCR into routine diagnostics, standardization and validation processes of qPCR assays and data had to be addressed [<a href=\"https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/btn-2019-0064#B4\" id=\"B4R\">4</a>]. A first step was the publication of the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/btn-2019-0064#B5\" id=\"B5R\">5</a>], which has led to a certain degree of standardization in the validation process of qPCR assays across different laboratories. In order to standardize the qPCR data format the real-time PCR data markup language (RDML) [<a href=\"https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/btn-2019-0064#B13\" id=\"B13R\">13</a>], which stores the data in a compressed extensible markup language file, was designed [<a href=\"https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/btn-2019-0064#B6\" id=\"B6R\">6</a>]. RDML stores the raw data acquired by the qPCR instrument as well as the information required for its interpretation, such as sample annotation and cycling protocol. A comprehensive review of 27 open-access software packages and tools for qPCR data analysis reported that most tools use their own file format and only a fraction of the currently existing tools support the standardized data exchange format RDML [<a href=\"https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/btn-2019-0064#B7\" id=\"B7R\">7</a>]. The lack of a common standard for qPCR data makes it difficult to share and analyze data across different qPCR platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The high-throughput character of qPCR analysis in infectious disease diagnosis easily leads to a rapid accumulation of raw data that needs to be quality controlled and interpreted in order to correctly identify and quantify infectious agents. Therefore, access to well-designed, user-friendly and semi-automated software facilitating the storage, quality control (QC) and analysis of diagnostic qPCR data is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI), the deliberate exposure of human volunteers to fully infectious malaria parasites, has proven to be safe and well tolerated, and accelerates the evaluation of malaria vaccines candidates in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/btn-2019-0064#B8\" id=\"B8R\">8</a>,<a href=\"https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/btn-2019-0064#B9\" id=\"B9R\">9</a>]. Volunteers participating in CHMIs must be monitored closely to ensure volunteer safety. Blood is drawn twice daily for up to 2&nbsp;weeks and screened for&nbsp;<em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>&nbsp;parasites by thick blood smear microscopy, and after the first appearance of blood-stage parasites the antimalarial treatment is initiated. Nowadays, more sensitive qPCR is increasingly used in CHMI to closely monitor parasitemia levels, which improves the safety of participants [<a href=\"https://www.future-science.com/doi/10.2144/btn-2019-0064#B10\" id=\"B10R\">10</a>]. In order to manage the vast amount of qPCR data generated during a series of CHMI studies with more than 250 individuals included and conducted in Tanzania and Equatorial Guinea, we decided to design and build a platform that facilities the analysis and interpretation of diagnostic qPCR data. We identified several key features which in our opinion would be required for such software:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Highly adaptable and integrative: a solution that can be easily adapted to a variety of qPCR assays, supports semi-automated data analysis and integrates into existing sample workflow;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Data traceability throughout analysis process: the use of an audit trail and community data standards to ensure high data integrity;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Accessibility and reliability of software: Platform-independent, open-source and low-maintenance software that could be deployed rapidly to new laboratories and other projects using qPCR analysis as&nbsp;a monitoring tool.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To address these needs, we developed the web-based, open-source platform ELIMU-MDx (Electronic Laboratory Information and Management Utensil for Molecular Diagnostics).</p>"

This study investigated whether mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy coupled with supervised machine learning could constitute an alternative method for rapid malaria screening, directly from dried human blood spots.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Methods</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Filter papers containing dried blood spots (DBS) were obtained from a cross-sectional malaria survey in 12 wards in southeastern Tanzania in 2018/19. The DBS were scanned using attenuated total reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometer to obtain high-resolution MIR spectra in the range 4000&nbsp;cm&minus;1&nbsp;to 500&nbsp;cm&minus;1. The spectra were cleaned to compensate for atmospheric water vapour and CO2&nbsp;interference bands and used to train different classification algorithms to distinguish between malaria-positive and malaria-negative DBS papers based on PCR test results as reference. The analysis considered 296 individuals, including 123 PCR-confirmed malaria positives and 173 negatives. Model training was done using 80% of the dataset, after which the best-fitting model was optimized by bootstrapping of 80/20 train/test-stratified splits. The trained models were evaluated by predicting&nbsp;<em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>&nbsp;positivity in the 20% validation set of DBS.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Logistic regression was the best-performing model. Considering PCR as reference, the models attained overall accuracies of 92% for predicting&nbsp;<em>P. falciparum</em>&nbsp;infections (specificity&thinsp;=&thinsp;91.7%; sensitivity&thinsp;=&thinsp;92.8%) and 85% for predicting mixed infections of&nbsp;<em>P. falciparum</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Plasmodium ovale</em>&nbsp;(specificity&thinsp;=&thinsp;85%, sensitivity&thinsp;=&thinsp;85%) in the field-collected specimen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These results demonstrate that mid-infrared spectroscopy coupled with supervised machine learning (MIR-ML) could be used to screen for malaria parasites in human DBS. The approach could have potential for rapid and high-throughput screening of&nbsp;<em>Plasmodium</em>&nbsp;in both non-clinical settings (e.g., field surveys) and clinical settings (diagnosis to aid case management). However, before the approach can be used, we need additional field validation in other study sites with different parasite populations, and in-depth evaluation of the biological basis of the MIR signals. Improving the classification algorithms, and model training on larger datasets could also improve specificity and sensitivity. The MIR-ML spectroscopy system is physically robust, low-cost, and requires minimum maintenance.</p>"

A limited but growing body of studies have also explored the interactions between CHWs&rsquo; personal, communal and professional identities and the implications of these for their profession. CHWs possess multiple, overlapping roles and identities, which makes them effective primary health care providers when properly supported with adequate resources, but it also limits their ability to implement interventions that only target certain members of their community, follow standard business working days and hours. In some situations, it even prevents them from performing certain duties when it comes to sensitive topics such as family planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Methods</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand the multiple identities of CHWs, a mixture of qualitative and ethnographic methods was utilized, such as participant observation, open-ended and semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussions with CHWs, their supervisors, and their clients. The observation period began in October 2013 and ended in June 2014. This study was based on implementation research conducted by the Connect Project in Rufiji, Ulanga and Kilombero Districts in Tanzania and aimed to understand the role of CHWs in the provision of maternal and child health services in rural areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To our knowledge, this was the first study that employed an ethnographic approach to examine the relationship between personal, communal and professional identities, and its implications for CHWs&rsquo; work in Tanzania. Our findings suggest that it is difficult to distinguish between personal and professional identities among CHWs in rural areas. Important aspects of CHW services such as personalization, access, and equity of health services were influenced by CHWs&rsquo; position as local agents. However, the study also found that their personal identity sometimes inhibited CHWs in speaking about issues related to family planning and sexual health. Being local, CHWs were viewed according to the social norms of the area that consider the gender and age of each worker, which tended to constrain their work in family planning and other areas. Furthermore, the communities welcomed and valued CHWs when they had curative medicines; however, when medical stocks were delayed, the community viewed the CHWs with suspicion and disinterest. Community members who received curative services from CHWs also tended to become more receptive to their preventative health care work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although CHWs&rsquo; multiple roles constrained certain aspects of their work in line with prevalent social norms, overall, the multiple roles they fulfilled had a positive effect by keeping CHWs embedded in their community and earned them trust from community members, which enhanced their ability to provide personalized, equitable and relevant services. However, CHWs needed a support system that included functional supply chains, supervision, and community support to help them retain their role as health care providers and enabled them to provide curative, preventative, and referral services</p>"

Three major reports [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002946#pmed.1002946.ref001\">1</a>&ndash;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002946#pmed.1002946.ref003\">3</a>] and an increasing body of empirical work (e.g., [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002946#pmed.1002946.ref004\">4</a>&ndash;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002946#pmed.1002946.ref006\">6</a>]) identified deep and pervasive deficits in quality undermining progress toward the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of health and wellness for all by 2030. Whether this attention translates into effective action in the near future will depend on national leaders seizing the opportunity to change health systems for improved outcomes. How can policymakers and researchers coordinate to ensure that action is informed by evidence and that policy changes are assessed for generalizable insight? To address this question, we gathered leaders in global health active along a spectrum from generating insight in individual studies to making policy that affects millions of individuals and present some of their thoughts here. All have identified health system quality as a key element of progress; each brings a distinct perspective on what change will require in their country or context. As those setting the agenda in countries from India to Mexico, how do they see the future for health system quality? What is needed from the research community to accelerate progress towards improved health?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"article1.body1.p2\" name=\"article1.body1.p2\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Nepal, Gagan Thapa argues that strong political commitment is required to ensure that each individual has access to affordable and quality healthcare. Political actors need to be informed about issues related to affordability and other quality issues related to health services and have the political will to resolve them. Critical reform areas such as medical education, procurement of medicines, minimum quality standards, regulation, and partnerships with the private sector will require meaningful engagement of lawmakers as well as their commitment to increases in national budgets for health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"article1.body1.p3\" name=\"article1.body1.p3\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>People in all countries must be empowered to demand health services that are responsive to their health needs. We have to be better at giving people platforms to express their health needs by including citizen voices during policymaking, budgeting, and planning processes of governments. Yet people are ill-informed about their rights to access quality and affordable healthcare. All too often, people do not access care because it is too expensive, inconvenient, remote from their household, or insensitive to their cultural practices. Many face catastrophic expenditures because of the high costs of surgery, medicines, and related costs for travel and accommodation. We need to have the political courage to include citizen voices in government processes, understand and document the difficulties people face, and use creative methods to resolve them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"article1.body1.p4\" name=\"article1.body1.p4\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health has been for too long the sole domain of Ministries of Health and their supporting technical partners: WHO, UNICEF, and others. The language of health policy is far too complex, and its approaches are technical. Thus, political leaders have been prevented from taking up this worthy cause. As the High-Quality Health Systems in the SDG Era report points out [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002946#pmed.1002946.ref001\">1</a>], the quality agenda requires strong political commitment, and the language used in the health discourse must be understandable and directed toward political actors&mdash;extending from issues that people face and challenges in delivering health services to potential solutions for reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"article1.body1.p5\" name=\"article1.body1.p5\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Address Malata, one of the most compelling ideas for improving healthcare quality is that tried and tested measures that have improved quality of care in high-income countries cannot just be adopted for the health sector in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Country- and in some cases site-specific measures and practices need to be researched, tried, and tested in target areas before being implemented. In particular, it is evident that many LMICs like Malawi are not making significant progress in maternal healthcare as indicators are still poor [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002946#pmed.1002946.ref007\">7</a>]. A rise in noncommunicable diseases has also strained the healthcare system [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002946#pmed.1002946.ref008\">8</a>]. Therefore, there is a need to have a more strategic conversation among researchers, policymakers, educators, and practitioners in countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"article1.body1.p6\" name=\"article1.body1.p6\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So as to induce policymakers to act, several types of evidence will be needed. First, robust data on mortality (especially maternal and neonatal) related to poor quality of care. Second, a systematic assessment of what difference minimal investment in various measures of quality care can make in saving lives. Finally, evidence is required to indicate that some quality of care packages are not necessarily too expensive to be employed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"article1.body1.p7\" name=\"article1.body1.p7\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Tanzania, efforts to improve high perinatal and maternal mortality rates have stagnated [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002946#pmed.1002946.ref009\">9</a>]. The bottleneck is not with typical quality improvement targets, such as provider knowledge; it is much deeper, within the structure of the health system, asserts Sanam Roder-DeWan. Women and newborns are dying because the system is not designed to maximize its own assets. The majority of women are delivering in facilities where even highly skilled providers could not deliver the quality of care that is needed to save lives: emergency cesarean sections are impossible and often require resources and expertise that is several hours travel away. The system was designed to place delivery services for &ldquo;low risk&rdquo; women close to home. This is laudable but hinges heavily on the assumption that we can accurately risk-stratify women. Unfortunately we cannot, because approximately 30% of low-risk pregnancies develop complications [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002946#pmed.1002946.ref010\">10</a>]. Such a high proportion is far too great for remote facilities with poor referral links to cope. The system must be redesigned to allow all women to deliver in, or very close to, a facility with comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (CEmONC) services [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002946#pmed.1002946.ref001\">1</a>]. Facilities without CEmONC capacity should specialize in care that can be expertly delivered at that level, such as antenatal and postnatal care. Other components of redesign are transport, dignified maternity waiting options, and midwifery-led low-intervention units. Tanzania has taken the first important step of expanding CEmONC capacity, and committing to fully redesigning service delivery is the next big step to take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"article1.body1.p8\" name=\"article1.body1.p8\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manoj Jhalani notes that in India, at Sub-Health Centres catering to population groups of about 5,000 people, Auxiliary Nurse Midwives with short-duration midwifery training are expected to provide reproductive, maternal, and child health services, including delivery care. This strategy was designed at a time when access to safe delivery was constrained by cultural and geographic barriers [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002946#pmed.1002946.ref011\">11</a>]. Expanding such access for delivery has not led to commensurate reductions in maternal and early newborn mortality. Conversely, care for chronic diseases, including ambulatory care, is currently available at higher level facilities, limiting geographic and financial access, and compromising early detection and follow-up for treatment adherence. As a result, the burden of noncommunicable diseases has continued to increase [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002946#pmed.1002946.ref012\">12</a>]. Redesigning service delivery, wherein delivery and newborn care is provided at higher level facilities to ensure quality and long-term ambulatory care for chronic diseases is provided at peripheral facilities, is therefore the most transformative idea for India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"article1.body1.p9\" name=\"article1.body1.p9\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provision of comprehensive primary healthcare visualizing this shift to delivery of improved quality care is already national policy in India, in the form of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana health scheme, but requires the use of regularly updated data through dashboards to provide evidence of gains in conjunction with patient satisfaction surveys, so as to sustain and accelerate policy commitment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"article1.body1.p10\" name=\"article1.body1.p10\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As countries reach better levels of access to healthcare, quality becomes even more visible as a key element to bridge the gap towards universal health coverage and better results in health, argues Sebasti&aacute;n Garc&iacute;a-Sais&oacute;. Mexico has over the past two decades made important efforts towards universal healthcare but has struggled to improve health outcomes despite the investment made in health. This is one of the most compelling arguments towards quality improvement: no matter how much investment goes into health service provision, if quality is not at the center of all health interventions then improved results will not automatically follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"article1.body1.p11\" name=\"article1.body1.p11\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a fragmented federal health system with multiple institutions and levels interacting in terms of health insurance and service provision, Mexico has developed an important number of quality indicators based on episodic measurement of structural elements and user experiences. Despite this consideration, the system has yet to implement robust transverse information systems in order to systematically evaluate and monitor health outcomes, including the capacity to monitor individual health outcomes and follow patients throughout the system. This is particularly relevant at local levels and primary health service provision. Overall, there is an urgent need to improve local decision-making towards quality improvement, emphasizing the role of health and healthcare in equity, and the need for better transparency and accountability in resource allocation and utilization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"article1.body1.p12\" name=\"article1.body1.p12\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although priorities vary by country, health systems around the world are struggling to deliver high-quality care in the face of the long-standing challenges of maternal and child health and infectious diseases, along with the growing epidemic of noncommunicable disease. We call for research to channel people&rsquo;s voices, develop tools specifically for LMIC settings, test the reshaping of health systems to align care delivery with minimum quality standards, and learn from individual patient outcomes over time to inform system strengthening. Only then will health systems truly deliver for all.</p>"

        "abstract": "<p>Background Childhood diarrhea deaths have declined more than 80% from 1980 to 2015, in spite of an increase in the number of children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Possible drivers of this remarkable accomplishment can guide the further reduction of the half million annual child deaths from diarrhea that still occur. Methods We used the Lives Saved Tool, which models effects on mortality due to changes in coverage of preventive or therapeutic interventions or risk factors, for 50 LMIC to determine the proximal drivers of the diarrhea mortality reduction. Results Diarrhea treatment (oral rehydration solution [ORS], zinc, antibiotics for dysentery and management of persistent diarrhea) and use of rotavirus vaccine accounted for 49.7% of the diarrhea mortality reduction from 1980 to 2015. Improvements in nutrition (stunting, wasting, breastfeeding practices, vitamin A) accounted for 38.8% and improvements in water, sanitation and handwashing for 11.5%. The contribution of ORS was greater from 1980 to 2000 (58.0% of the reduction) than from 2000 to 2015 (30.7%); coverage of ORS increased from zero in 1980 to 29.5% in 2000 and more slowly to 44.1% by 2015. To eliminate the remaining childhood diarrhea deaths globally, all these interventions will be needed. Scaling up diarrhea treatment and rotavirus vaccine, to 90% coverage could reduce global child diarrhea mortality by 74.1% from 2015 levels by 2030. Adding improved nutrition could increase that to 89.1%. Finally, adding increased use of improved water sources, sanitation and handwashing could result in a 92.8% reduction from the 2015 level. Conclusions Employing the interventions that have resulted in such a large reduction in diarrhea mortality in the last 35 years can virtually eliminate remaining childhood diarrhea deaths by 2030.</p>"

In Tanzania, quality has been a major concern for many years, including the problem of ineffective and inadequate routine supportive supervision of healthcare providers by council health management teams. To address this, we developed and assessed an approach to improve quality of primary healthcare through enhanced routine supportive supervision. Mixed methods were used, combining trends of quantitative quality of care measurements with qualitative data mainly collected through in-depth interviews. The former allowed for identification of drivers of quality improvements and the latter investigated the perceived contribution of the new supportive supervision approach to these improvements. The results showed that the new approach managed to address quality issues that could be solved either solely by the healthcare provider, or in collaboration with the council. The new approach was able to improve and maintain crucial primary healthcare quality standards across different health facility level and owner categories in various contexts. Together with other findings reported in companion papers, we could show that the new supportive supervision approach not only served to assess quality of primary healthcare, but also to improve and maintain crucial primary healthcare quality standards. The new approach therefore presents a powerful tool to support, guide and drive quality improvement measures within council. It can thus be considered a suitable option to make routine supportive supervision more effective and adequate.</p>"

We aimed to investigate the bactericidal activity and safety profile of combinations of bedaquiline, pretomanid, moxifloxacin, and pyrazinamide in the first 8 weeks of treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.In this multicentre, open-label, partially randomised, phase 2b trial, we prospectively recruited patients with drug-susceptible or rifampicin-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis from seven sites in South Africa, two in Tanzania, and one in Uganda. Patients aged 18 years or older with sputum smear grade 1+ or higher were eligible for enrolment, and a molecular assay (GeneXpert or MTBDR<em>plus</em>) was used to confirm the diagnosis of tuberculosis and to distinguish between drug-susceptible and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. Patients who were HIV positive with a baseline CD4 cell count of less than 100 cells per uL were excluded. Patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using numbered treatment packs with sequential allocation by the pharmacist to receive 56 days of treatment with standard tuberculosis therapy (oral isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol; HRZE), or pretomanid (oral 200 mg daily) and pyrazinamide (oral 1500 mg daily) with either oral bedaquiline 400 mg daily on days 1&ndash;14 then 200 mg three times per week (BloadPaZ) or oral bedaquiline 200 mg daily (B200PaZ). Patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis received 56 days of the B200PaZ regimen plus moxifloxacin 400 mg daily (BPaMZ). All treatment groups were open label, and randomisation was not stratified. Patients, trial investigators and staff, pharmacists or dispensers, laboratory staff (with the exception of the mycobacteriology laboratory staff), sponsor staff, and applicable contract research organisations were not masked. The primary efficacy outcome was daily percentage change in time to sputum culture positivity (TTP) in liquid medium over days 0&ndash;56 in the drug-susceptible tuberculosis population, based on non-linear mixed-effects regression modelling of log10(TTP) over time. The efficacy analysis population contained patients who received at least one dose of medication and who had efficacy data available and had no major protocol violations. The safety population contained patients who received at least one dose of medication.

Between Oct 24, 2014, and Dec 15, 2015, we enrolled 180 patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis (59 were randomly assigned to BloadPaZ, 60 to B200PaZ, and 61 to HRZE) and 60 patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. 57 patients in the BloadPaZ group, 56 in the B200PaZ group, and 59 in the HRZE group were included in the primary analysis. B200PaZ produced the highest daily percentage change in TTP (5&middot;17% [95% Bayesian credibility interval 4&middot;61&ndash;5&middot;77]), followed by BloadPaZ (4&middot;87% [4&middot;31&ndash;5&middot;47]) and HRZE group (4&middot;04% [3&middot;67&ndash;4&middot;42]). The bactericidal activity in B200PaZ and BloadPaZ groups versus that in the HRZE group was significantly different. Higher proportions of patients in the BloadPaZ (six [10%] of 59) and B200PaZ (five [8%] of 60) groups discontinued the study drug than in the HRZE group (two [3%] of 61) because of adverse events. Liver enzyme elevations were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events and resulted in the withdrawal of ten patients (five [8%] in the BloadPaZ group, three [5%] in the B200PaZ group, and two [3%] in the HRZE group). Serious treatment-related adverse events affected two (3%) patients in the BloadPaZ group and one (2%) patient in the HRZE group. Seven (4%) patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis died and four (7%) patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis died. None of the deaths were considered to be related to treatment. B200PaZ is a promising regimen to treat patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis. The bactericidal activity of both these regimens suggests that they have the potential to shorten treatment, and the simplified dosing schedule of B200PaZ could improve treatment adherence in the field. However, these findings must be investigated further in a phase 3 trial assessing treatment outcomes.

        "abstract": "<p>Since 2012, the Zanzibar Malaria Elimination Program has been implementing reactive case detection (RACD). Health facility (HF) staff send individual malaria case notifications by using mobile phones, triggering a review of HF records and malaria testing and treatment at the household level by a district malaria surveillance officer. We assessed the completeness and timeliness of this system, from case notification to household-level response. We reviewed two years (2015&ndash;2016) of primary register information in 40 randomly selected HFs on Zanzibar&rsquo;s two islands Unguja and Pemba and database records of case notifications from all registered HFs for the period 2013&ndash;16. The operational coverage of the system was calculated as proportion of HF-registered cases that were successfully reviewed and followed up at their household. Timeliness was defined as completion of each step within 1 day. Public HFs notified almost all registered cases (91% in Unguja and 87% in Pemba), and 74% of cases registered at public HFs were successfully followed up at their household in Unguja and 79% in Pemba. Timely operational coverage (defined as each step, diagnosis to notification, notification to review, and review to household-level response, completed within 1 day) was achieved for only 25% of registered cases in Unguja and 30% in Pemba. Records and data from private HFs on Unguja indicated poor notification performance in the private sector. Although the RACD system in Zanzibar achieved high operational coverage, timeliness was suboptimal. Patients diagnosed with malaria at private HFs and hospitals appeared to be largely missed by the RACD system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

        "abstract": "<p>Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDGs) mobilised countries to reduce child mortality by two thirds the 1990 rate in 2015. While India did not reach MDG 4, it considerably reduced child mortality in the MDG-era. Efficient and targeted interventions and ad- equate monitoring are necessary to further progress in improvements to child health. Looking forward to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-era, the Indian Council of Medical Research and The INCLEN Trust International conducted a national research priority setting ex- ercise for maternal, child, newborn health, and maternal and child nutrition. Here, results are reported for child health. The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHN- RI) method for research priority setting was employed. Research ideas were crowd-sourced from a network of child health experts from across India; these were refined and consolidated into research op- tions (ROs) which were scored against five weighted criteira to arrive weighted Research Priority Scores (wRPS). National and regional pri- ority lists were prepared. 90 experts contributed 596 ideas that were consolidated into 101 research options (ROs). These were scored by 233 experts na- tionwide. National wRPS for ROs ranged between 0.92 and 0.51. The majority of the top research priorities related to development of cost-effective interventions and their implementation, and impact evaluations, improving data quality and monitoring of existing pro- grams, or improving the management of morbidities. The research priorities varied between regions; the Economic Action Group and North-Eastern states prioritised questions relating to delivering inter- ventions at community- or household-level, whereas the North-East- ern states and Union Territories prioritised research questions involv- ing managing and measuring malaria, and the Southern and Western states prioritised research questions involving pharmacovigilance of vaccines, impact of newly introduced vaccines, and delivery of vac- cines to hard-to-reach populations.&nbsp;Research priorities varied geographically, according the stage of development of the area and mostly pertained to implemen- tation sciences, which was expected given diversity in epidemiological profiles. Priority setting should help guide investment decisions by na- tional and international agencies, therefore encouraging researchers to focus on priority areas. The ICMR has launched a grants programme for implementation research on maternal and child health to pursue research priorities identified by this exercise.</p>"

Data were analyzed from the baseline survey of a cluster randomized control trial in Rufiji, Tanzania. One woman of reproductive age was randomly surveyed from each eligible household, totaling 1006 individuals. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the relationship between agricultural indicators and dietary diversity.&nbsp;Median dietary diversity score for women was 3.00 (interquartile range: 2-3). Approximately 73% of households grew at least 1 crop in the previous year. Women&rsquo;s dietary diversity score was positively associated with cropping diversity (<em>P</em>&nbsp;for trend = .04), ownership of livestock (adjusted coefficient: 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08-0.44;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;= .005), cash crop production (adjusted coefficient: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.03-0.41;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;= .02), and production of pulses (adjusted coefficient: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.27-0.74;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;&lt; .0001) and other vegetables (adjusted coefficient: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.11-1.17;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&nbsp;= .02).&nbsp;Average dietary diversity is well below the recommended 5 food groups per day, a widely used indicator of micronutrient adequacy. Since the majority of households participate in agriculture, the efforts to promote agricultural diversification and/or specialization and sale of agricultural goods may positively influence dietary diversity and associated health and nutrition outcomes.</h2>"

We used an unmatched case-control study design, with 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration assessed in the first trimester. Cases were individuals with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth, premature birth, or small for gestational age births (SGA). Unconditional logistic regression and weighted logistic regression models were used to describe the associations of 25(OH)D concentration with the composite of adverse pregnancy outcome and individual adverse pregnancy outcomes, respectively.

At 10&ndash;100 times higher than current human doses, ivermectin is a known teratogen in mammals. During these campaigns with recommended doses, pregnant women might be inadvertently exposed. We therefore aimed to evaluate the existing evidence for serious and non-serious adverse events after ivermectin exposure in pregnant women. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched relevant databases and trial registry platforms on July 15, 2018, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that reported adverse events in pregnant women. We did not use language or date restrictions. Outcomes of interest were spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, congenital anomalies, and neonatal death (serious adverse events), as well as maternal morbidity, preterm births, and low birthweight (adverse events). The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs. We did the meta-analysis of observational studies and RCTs separately. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, protocol CRD42016046914. We identified 147 records, of which only five observational studies and one RCT were included for quantitative analysis; these studies were published between 1990 and 2008, and were done in six African countries. 893 women with 899 pregancy outcomes were included, of whom 496 pregnant women (500 pregnancy outcomes) received ivermectin inadvertently during MDA campaigns in the observational studies and 397 pregnant women (399 pregnancy outcomes) purposely received ivermectin as part of the open-label RCT. No study reported neonatal deaths, maternal morbidity, preterm births, or low birthweight. It is unclear whether exposure to ivermectin during pregnancy increases the risk of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths (odds ratio [OR] 1&middot;15 [95% CI 0&middot;75&ndash;1&middot;78] with very low certainty of evidence for the four observational studies and 0&middot;62 [0&middot;18&ndash;2&middot;14] with very low certainty of evidence for the RCT) or congenital anomalies (OR 1&middot;69 [95% CI 0&middot;83&ndash;3&middot;41] with very low certainty of evidence for the five observational studies and 1&middot;10 [0&middot;07&ndash;17&middot;65] with very low certainty of evidence for the RCT). There is insufficient evidence to conclude on the safety profile of ivermectin during pregnancy. Treatment campaigns should focus additional efforts on preventing inadvertent treatment of pregnant women.</p>"

Clinical trials using whole-sporozoite-based vaccination approaches such as the Sanaria PfSPZ Vaccine, followed by controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) to assess vaccine efficacy offer a unique opportunity to study the immune response during&nbsp;<em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>&nbsp;infection. Diverse populations of T cells that are not restricted to classical HLA (unconventional T cells) participate in the host response during&nbsp;<em>Plasmodium</em>&nbsp;infection. Although several populations of unconventional T cells exist, the majority of studies focused on TCR V&gamma;9V&delta;2 cells, the most abundant TCR &gamma;&delta; cell population in peripheral blood. In this study, we dissected the response of three TCR &gamma;&delta; cell subsets and mucosal-associated invariant T cells in healthy volunteers immunized with PfSPZ Vaccine and challenged by CHMI using Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge. Using a flow cytometry-based unbiased analysis followed by T cell cloning, several findings were made. Whereas major ex vivo alterations were not detectable after immunization with PfSPZ Vaccine, TCR V&delta;2, and mucosal-associated invariant T cells expanded after asexual blood-stage parasitemia induced by CHMI. CHMI, but not vaccination, also induced the activation of TCR V&delta;1 and V&delta;1&minus;V&delta;2&minus;&nbsp;&gamma;&delta; T cells. The activated TCR V&delta;1 cells were oligoclonal, suggesting clonal expansion, and upon repeated CHMI, showed diminished response, indicating long-term alterations induced by blood-stage parasitemia. Some TCR V&delta;1 clones recognized target cells in the absence of parasite-derived Ags, thus suggesting recognition of self-molecules. These findings reveal the articulate participation of different populations of unconventional T cells to&nbsp;<em>P. falciparum</em>&nbsp;infection.</p>"

While there, they live in makeshift semi-open structures, usually far from organized health systems and where insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) do not provide adequate protection. This study evaluated the potential of a recently developed technology, eave ribbons treated with the spatial repellent transfluthrin, for protecting migratory rice farmers in rural southeastern Tanzania against indoor-biting and outdoor-biting mosquitoes. In the first test, eave ribbons (0.1&nbsp;m&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;24&nbsp;m each) treated with 1.5% transfluthrin solution were compared to untreated ribbons in 24 randomly selected huts in three migratory communities over 48 nights. Host-seeking mosquitoes indoors and outdoors were monitored nightly (18.00&ndash;07.00&nbsp;h) using CDC light traps and CO2-baited BG malaria traps, respectively. The second test compared efficacies of eave ribbons treated with 1.5% or 2.5% transfluthrin in 12 huts over 21 nights. Finally, 286 farmers were interviewed to assess perceptions about eave ribbons, and their willingness to pay for them. In the two experiments, when treated eave ribbons were applied, the reduction in indoor densities ranged from 56 to 77% for&nbsp;<em>Anopheles arabiensis</em>, 36 to 60% for&nbsp;<em>Anopheles funestus</em>, 72 to 84% for&nbsp;<em>Culex,</em>&nbsp;and 80 to 98% for&nbsp;<em>Mansonia</em>&nbsp;compared to untreated ribbons. Reduction in outdoor densities was 38 to 77% against&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>, 36 to 64% against&nbsp;<em>An. funestus,</em>&nbsp;63 to 88% against&nbsp;<em>Culex</em>, and 47 to 98% against&nbsp;<em>Mansonia</em>. There was no difference in protection between the two transfluthrin doses. In the survey, 58% of participants perceived the ribbons to be effective in reducing mosquito bites. Ninety per cent were willing to pay for the ribbons, the majority of whom were willing to pay but less than US$2.17 (5000 TZS), one-third of the current prototype cost. Transfluthrin-treated eave ribbons can protect migratory rice farmers, living in semi-open makeshift houses in remote farms, against indoor-biting and outdoor-biting mosquitoes. The technology is acceptable to users and could potentially complement ITNs. Further studies should investigate durability and epidemiological impact of eave ribbons, and the opportunities for improving affordability to users.</p>"

We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of febrile children with severe malnutrition enrolled in a randomized, controlled trial in primary care centers in Tanzania. The clinical outcome of children with severe malnutrition defined by anthropometric measures and clinical signs was compared between two electronic clinical diagnostic algorithms: ePOCT, which uses weight-for-age and mid-upper arm circumference to identify and manage severe malnutrition, and ALMANACH, which uses the clinical signs of edema of both feet and visible severe wasting. Those identified as having severe malnutrition by the algorithms in each arm were prescribed antibiotics and referred to the hospital. From December 2014 to February 2016, 106 febrile children were enrolled and randomized in the parent study, and met the criteria to be included in the present analysis. ePOCT identified 56/57 children with severe malnutrition using anthropometric measures, whereas ALMANACH identified 2/49 children with severe malnutrition using clinical signs. The proportion of clinical failure, defined as the development of severe symptoms by day 7 or persisting symptoms at day 7 (per-protocol), was 1.8% (1/56) in the ePOCT arm versus 16.7% (8/48) in the Algorithm for the MANagement of Childhood illnesses arm (risk difference &minus;14.9%, 95% CI &minus;26.0%, &minus;3.8%; risk ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.01, 0.83).

        "abstract": "<p>Understanding the dispersal dynamics of invasive mosquito species is fundamental to improve vector surveillance and to target control efforts.&nbsp;<em>Aedes albopictus</em>&nbsp;has been deemed a poor flyer as its range of active dispersal is generally assumed to be limited to a few hundred metres, while laboratory studies suggest this mosquito could actually fly several kilometres. The discrepancy may be due to differences in the local environment or to the methodological approach. In Switzerland,&nbsp;<em>Ae. albopictus</em>&nbsp;has been present since 2003 and has since then expanded its range. While passive dispersal is a key driver, it remains unclear how far this mosquito spreads through active flight and what the age structure and size of the local population&nbsp;are, all important parameters for vector surveillance and control.&nbsp;We investigated the active dispersal, daily survival rate and population size of&nbsp;<em>Ae. albopictus</em>&nbsp;in mark-release-recapture studies in Coldrerio and Lugano, two areas of intensive control in Switzerland. To mark mosquitoes emerging from breeding sites, we used self-marking units with fluorescent pigment that have minimal impact on mosquito survival and behaviour. We recaptured the adult mosquitoes with BG-Sentinel traps within a radius of 1 km from the marking units over 22 consecutive days.&nbsp;We found that 77.5% of the recaptured&nbsp;<em>Ae. albopictus</em>&nbsp;individuals flew further than 250&nbsp;m, the limit that is usually deemed sufficient for vector containment. The average age of females and males was 8.6&nbsp;days and 7.8&nbsp;days in Coldrerio and Lugano, respectively, while the estimated mosquito population densities were 134 mosquitoes/ha in Coldrerio and 767 mosquitoes/ha in Lugano.&nbsp;Self-marking units are an effective tool to mark wild mosquitoes. Using this approach, we found that mosquitoes survive long enough to potentially transmit arboviral disease in our study area and that host-seeking&nbsp;<em>Ae. albopictus</em>&nbsp;females may travel further than previously assumed for European mosquito populations. This finding has direct implications for vector control as emergency treatments around positive cases, as well as surveillance and control around detections of new infestations, might need to be extended beyond the usual recommended range of just a few hundred metres.</p>"

The intervention was associated with an increase in newborn counseling (&beta;: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.13, 1.35) but no evidence of change across 17 additional indicators of quality. On average, facilities reached 39% implementation. Comparing facilities with the highest implementation of the intervention to control facilities again showed improvement on only one of the 18 quality indicators.&nbsp;A multi-faceted quality improvement intervention resulted in no meaningful improvement in quality. Evidence suggests this is due to both failure to sustain a high-level of implementation and failure in theory: quality improvement interventions targeted at the clinic-level in primary care clinics with weak starting quality, including poor infrastructure and low provider competence, may not be effective.</p>"

Die h&auml;ufigsten Manifestationsorte einer extrapulmonalen Tuberkulose sind Lymphknoten, die Pleura und die Knochen. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit der Dissemination einer Tuberkulose erh&ouml;ht sich bei einem immunsupprimierten Patienten, z.B. durch HIV oder einen TNF-alpha-Inhibitor. Die Diagnose einer extrapulmonalen Tuberkulose ist schwierig. Oft ist eine invasive Herangehensweise zur Probengewinnung n&ouml;tig, um den Tuberkuloseerreger M. tuberculosis durch Mikroskopie, Kultur, Mikrobiologie (z.B. Xpert&reg; MTB/RIF) oder Histologie nachzuweisen. Die Behandlung einer extrapulmonalen Tuberkulose folgt den Richtlinien der Therapie einer pulmonalen Tuberkulose mit einer zweimonatigen antibiotischen Vierfachtherapie (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambuthol und Pyrazinamid), gefolgt von einer viermonatigen antibiotischen Zweifachtherapie (Rifampicin und Isoniazid). Die Dauer der antibiotischen Behandlung ist bei einer tuberkul&ouml;sen Meningitis auf ein Jahr und bei einer skelettalen Dissemination auf sechs bis neun Monate verl&auml;ngert.

Extrapulmonary tuberculosis mostly affects lymph nodes, pleura and bones. Patients with immunosuppressive conditions such as an HIV co-infection or immunosuppressive therapies like TNF-alpha-inhibitors have a higher risk of a dissemination of tuberculosis. Diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis is difficult, as microbiological testing mostly requires invasive procedures to obtain a sample for direct proof of tuberculosis by microscopy, culture, molecular methods (e.g. Xpert&reg; MTB/RIF) or histology. Treatment follows guidelines of pulmonary tuberculosis with a two-month regimen consisting of four drugs (rifampicin, isoniazide, pyrazinamide and ethambuthol), followed by a four-month therapy with two drugs (rifampicin and isoniazide). Duration of therapy is extended in tuberculous meningitis to one year and in a skeletal dissemination up to six to nine months. Corticosteroids are recommended in cerebral and pericardial tuberculosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Keywords:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/keyword/Extrapulmonary+Tuberculosis\">Extrapulmonary tuberculosis</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/keyword/HIV\">HIV</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/keyword/Xpert%C2%AE+MTB%2FRIF\">Xpert&reg; MTB/RIF</a></p>"

This&nbsp;systematic&nbsp;review&nbsp;aims to collate, compare and summarise the application of both methods in this field and to identify common healthcare settings and problems that have been modelled using SDM and ABM.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>METHODS:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, MathSciNet, ACM Digital Library, HMIC, Econlit and Global&nbsp;Health&nbsp;databases to identify literature for this&nbsp;review. We described papers meeting the inclusion criteria using descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis, and made comparisons between the identified SDM and ABM literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>RESULTS:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We identified 28 papers using SDM methods and 11 papers using ABM methods, one of which used hybrid SDM-ABM to simulate&nbsp;health&nbsp;system&nbsp;behaviour. The majority of SDM, ABM and hybrid&nbsp;modelling&nbsp;papers simulated&nbsp;health&nbsp;systems&nbsp;based in high income countries. Emergency and acute care, and elderly care and long-term care services were the most frequently simulated&nbsp;health&nbsp;system&nbsp;settings,&nbsp;modelling&nbsp;the impact of&nbsp;health&nbsp;policies and interventions such as those targeting stretched and under resourced healthcare services, patient length of stay in healthcare facilities and undesirable patient outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>CONCLUSIONS:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Future work should now turn to&nbsp;modelling&nbsp;health&nbsp;systems&nbsp;in low- and middle-income countries to aid our understanding of&nbsp;health&nbsp;system&nbsp;functioning in these settings and allow stakeholders and researchers to assess the impact of policies or interventions before implementation. Hybrid&nbsp;modelling&nbsp;of&nbsp;health&nbsp;systems&nbsp;is still relatively novel but with increasing software developments and a growing demand to account for both complex&nbsp;system&nbsp;feedback and heterogeneous behaviour exhibited by those who access or deliver healthcare, we expect a boost in their use to model&nbsp;health&nbsp;systems.</p>"

The rate of new infections has decreased substantially since 2005, the life expectancy of people living with HIV has increased and the mortality rate has declined. Yet still a lot needs to be achieved to stop the ongoing epidemic. Women are still at a higher risk to get infected and stigma and discrimination are a hindrance to further reduce the incidence. Challenges like the lack of technical capacities, especially to perform viral load and resistance testing, refusal of testing or condom use and increasing drug resistance to first-line therapies jeopardize the goal of 90&ndash;90&ndash;90: 90 % of people tested, 90 % of positives under care and 90 % of treated persons virologically controlled. New testing strategies and medication with higher efficacies which, when taken regularly, stop the transmission completely, provide hope in the fight against HIV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Keywords:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/keyword/HIV%2FAIDS\">HIV/AIDS</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/keyword/Sub-saharan+Africa\">sub-Saharan Africa</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/keyword/Antiretroviral+Therapy\">antiretroviral therapy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/keyword/Prevention\">prevention</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/keyword/90%E2%80%9390%E2%80%9390\">90&ndash;90&ndash;90</a></p>"

We examined factors associated with the decline and projected the impact of scaling up interventions or reducing risk factors on diarrhea deaths. Methods We reviewed economic, health, and diarrhea-related policies, reports and programs implemented during 1980 to 2015. We used the Lives Saved Tool to determine the percentage reduction in diarrhea-specific mortality attributable to changes in coverage of the interventions and risk factors, including direct diarrhea-related interventions, nutrition, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). We projected the number of diarrhea deaths that could be prevented in 2030, assuming near universal coverage of different intervention packages. Results Diarrhea-specific mortality among under-five children in Tanzania declined by 89% from 35.3 deaths per 1000 live births in 1980 to 3.9 deaths per 1000 live births in 2015. Factors associated with diarrhea-specific under-five mortality reduction included oral rehydration solution (ORS) use, changes in stunting prevalence, vitamin A supplementation, rotavirus vaccine, change in wasting prevalence and change in age-appropriate breastfeeding practices. Universal coverage of direct diarrhea, nutrition and WASH interventions has the potential reduce the diarrhea-specific mortality rate by 90%. Conclusions Scaling up of a few key childhood interventions such as ORS and nutrition, and reducing the prevalence of stunting would address the remaining diarrhea-specific under-five mortality by 2030.</p>"

        "abstract": "<p><strong>Abstract.</strong>&nbsp;Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the top 10 infectious diseases with highest mortality globally since the 1990s despite effective chemotherapy. Among 10 million patients that fell ill with tuberculosis in the year 2017, 36 % were undiagnosed or detected and not reported; the number goes as high as 55 % in Tanzania, showing that the diagnosis of TB is a big challenge in the developing countries. There have been great advancements in TB diagnostics with introduction of the molecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, lipoarabinomannan urine strip test, and molecular line-probe assays. However, most of the hospitals in Tanzania still rely on the TB score chart in children, the WHO screening questions in adults, acid-fast bacilli and chest x-ray for the diagnosis of TB. Xpert MTB/RIF has been rolled-out but remains a challenge in settings where the samples for testing must be transported over many kilometers. Imaging by sonography &ndash; nowadays widely available even in rural settings of Tanzania &ndash; has been shown to be a useful tool in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Despite all the efforts and new diagnostics, 30&ndash;50 % of patients in high-burden TB countries are still empirically treated for tuberculosis. More efforts need to be placed if we are to reduce the death toll by 90 % until 2030.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Keywords:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/keyword/Tuberculosis\">Tuberculosis</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/keyword/Tanzania\">Tanzania</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/keyword/Extrapulmonary+Tuberculosis\">extrapulmonary tuberculosis</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/keyword/Xpert+MTB%2FRIF\">Xpert MTB/RIF</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/keyword/Focused+Assessment+With+Sonography+For+Hiv-associated+Tuberculosis+%5C%28FASH%5C%29\">focused assessment with sonography for HIV-associated tuberculosis (FASH)</a></p>"

In Tanzania, quality has been a major concern for many years, including the problem of ineffective and inadequate routine supportive supervision of healthcare providers by council health management teams. To address this, we developed and assessed an approach to improve quality of primary healthcare through enhanced routine supportive supervision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Methods</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed methods were used, combining trends of quantitative quality of care measurements with qualitative data mainly collected through in-depth interviews.

The new approach was able to improve and maintain crucial primary healthcare quality standards across different health facility level and owner categories in various contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with other findings reported in companion papers, we could show that the new supportive supervision approach not only served to assess quality of primary healthcare, but also to improve and maintain crucial primary healthcare quality standards. The new approach therefore presents a powerful tool to support, guide and drive quality improvement measures within council. It can thus be considered a suitable option to make routine supportive supervision more effective and adequate.</p>"

        "abstract": "<p>Since 2012, the Zanzibar Malaria Elimination Program has been implementing reactive case detection (RACD). Health facility (HF) staff send individual malaria case notifications by using mobile phones, triggering a review of HF records and malaria testing and treatment at the household level by a district malaria surveillance officer. We assessed the completeness and timeliness of this system, from case notification to household-level response. We reviewed two years (2015&ndash;2016) of primary register information in 40 randomly selected HFs on Zanzibar&rsquo;s two islands Unguja and Pemba and database records of case notifications from all registered HFs for the period 2013&ndash;16. The operational coverage of the system was calculated as proportion of HF-registered cases that were successfully reviewed and followed up at their household. Timeliness was defined as completion of each step within 1 day. Public HFs notified almost all registered cases (91% in Unguja and 87% in Pemba), and 74% of cases registered at public HFs were successfully followed up at their household in Unguja and 79% in Pemba. Timely operational coverage (defined as each step, diagnosis to notification, notification to review, and review to household-level response, completed within 1 day) was achieved for only 25% of registered cases in Unguja and 30% in Pemba. Records and data from private HFs on Unguja indicated poor notification performance in the private sector. Although the RACD system in Zanzibar achieved high operational coverage, timeliness was suboptimal. Patients diagnosed with malaria at private HFs and hospitals appeared to be largely missed by the RACD system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&copy; The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[open-access]&nbsp;This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" target=\"xrefwindow\">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited</p>"

In sub-Saharan Africa, avoidance of treatment failure on second-line protease inhibitor therapy is critical as treatment options are limited. In the prospective observational study of the Kilombero &amp; Ulanga Antiretroviral Cohort in rural Tanzania, we assessed virologic failure (viral load &ge;1,000 copies/mL) and drug resistance mutations in bio-banked plasma samples 6&ndash;12 months after initiation of a protease inhibitor-based treatment regimen. Additionally, viral load was measured before start of protease inhibitor, a second time between 1&ndash;5 years after start, and at suspected treatment failure in patients with available bio-banked samples. We performed resistance testing if viral load was &ge;1000 copies/ml. Risk factors for virologic failure were analyzed using logistic regression. In total, 252 patients were included; of those 56% were female and 21% children. Virologic failure occurred 6&ndash;12 months after the start of a protease inhibitor in 26/199 (13.1%) of adults and 7/53 of children (13.2%). The prevalence of virologic failure did not change over time. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors drug resistance mutation testing performed at 6&ndash;12 months showed a positive signal in only 9/16 adults. No cases of resistance mutations for protease inhibitors were seen at this time. In samples taken between 1&ndash;5 years protease inhibitor resistance was demonstrated in 2/7 adults. In adult samples before protease inhibitor start, resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was detected in 30/41, and to non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors in 35/41 patients. In 15/16 pediatric samples, resistance to both drug classes but not for protease inhibitors was present. Our study confirms high early failure rates in adults and children treated with protease inhibitors, even in the absence of protease inhibitors resistance mutations, suggesting an urgent need for adherence support in this setting.</p>"

Rabies is an almost invariably fatal viral disease that causes a large public health and economic burden in Asia and Africa, despite being entirely vaccine preventable. With policy efforts now directed towards achieving a global goal of zero dog-mediated human rabies deaths by 2030, establishing effective surveillance tools is critical. Genomic data can provide important and unique insights into rabies spread and persistence that can direct control efforts. However, capacity for genomic research in low- and middle-income countries is held back by limited laboratory infrastructure, cost, supply chains and other logistical challenges. Here we present and validate an end-to-end workflow to facilitate affordable whole genome sequencing for rabies surveillance utilising nanopore technology. We used this workflow in Kenya, Tanzania and the Philippines to generate rabies virus genomes in two to three days, reducing costs to approximately &pound;60 per genome. This is over half the cost of metagenomic sequencing previously conducted for Tanzanian samples, which involved exporting samples to the UK and a three- to six-month lag time. Ongoing optimization of workflows are likely to reduce these costs further. We also present tools to support routine whole genome sequencing and interpretation for genomic surveillance. Moreover, combined with training workshops to empower scientists in-country, we show that local sequencing capacity can be readily established and sustainable, negating the common misperception that cutting-edge genomic research can only be conducted in high resource laboratories. More generally, we argue that the capacity to harness genomic data is a game-changer for endemic disease surveillance and should precipitate a new wave of researchers from low- and middle-income countries.&nbsp;</p>"

Molecular monitoring of residual malaria infections usually requires a large study size, therefore sampling and diagnostic processes need to be economical and optimized for high-throughput. A method comparison was undertaken to identify the most efficient diagnostic procedure for processing large collections of community samples with optimal test sensitivity, simplicity, and minimal costs.</span> <span style=\"color:#333333\">In a reactive case detection study conducted on Zanzibar, parasitaemia of 4590 individuals of all ages was investigated by a highly sensitive quantitative (q) PCR that targets multiple&nbsp;<em>var</em>gene copies per parasite genome. To reduce cost, a first round of positivity screening was performed on pools of dried blood spots from five individuals. Ten cycles of a pre-PCR were performed directly on the filter paper punches, followed by qPCR. In a second round, samples of positive pools were individually analysed by pre-PCR and qPCR.</span> <span style=\"color:#333333\">Prevalence in household members and neighbors of index cases was 1.7% (78/4590) with a geometric mean parasite density of 58 parasites/&micro;l blood. Using qPCR as gold standard, diagnostic sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) was 37% (29/78). Infections positive by qPCR but negative by RDT had mean densities of 15 parasites/&micro;l blood.</span> <span style=\"color:#333333\">The approach of pre-screening reactive case detection samples in pools of five was ideal for a low prevalence setting such as in Zanzibar. Performing direct PCR on filter paper punches saves substantial time and justifies the higher cost for a polymerase suitable for amplifying DNA directly from whole blood. Molecular monitoring in community samples provided a more accurate picture of infection prevalence, as it identified a potential reservoir of infection that was largely missed by RDT. The developed qPCR-based methodology for screening large sample sets represents primarily a research tool that should inform the design of malaria elimination strategies. It may also prove beneficial for diagnostic tasks in surveillance-response activities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

However, data are lacking on how medicine availability and stock-outs influence access to health services in Tanzania. The current study assesses the effects of medicine availability and stock-outs on healthcare utilization in Dodoma region, Tanzania. We conducted a cross-sectional study that combined information from households and healthcare facility surveys. A total of 4 hospitals and 89 public primary health facilities were surveyed. The facility surveys included observation, record review over a 3-month period prior to survey date, and interviews with key staff. In addition, 1237 households within the health facility catchment areas were interviewed. Data from the facility survey were linked with data from the household survey. Descriptive analysis and multivariate logistic regressions models were used to assess the effects of medicine availability and stock-outs on utilization patterns and to identify additional household-level factors associated with health service utilization. Eighteen medicines were selected as &lsquo;tracers&rsquo; to assess availability more generally, and these were continuously available in &sim;70% of the time in facilities across all districts over 3&thinsp;months of review. The main analysis showed that household&rsquo;s healthcare utilization was positively and significantly associated with continuous availability of all essential medicines for the surveyed facilities [odds ratio (OR) 3.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02&ndash;12.04;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.047]. Healthcare utilization was positively associated with household membership in the community health insurance funds (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.23&ndash;3.17;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.005) and exposure to healthcare education (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.84&ndash;4.08;&nbsp;<em>P</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.000). These results highlight the importance of medicine availability in promoting access to health services in low-income settings. Effective planning and medicine supply management from national to health facility level is an important component of quality health services.</p>"

IRS typically targets mosquitoes resting on walls, and in few cases, roofs and ceilings, using contact insecticides. Unfortunately, little attention is paid to where malaria vectors actually rest indoors, and how such knowledge could be used to improve IRS. This study investigated preferred resting surfaces of two major malaria vectors,&nbsp;<em>Anopheles funestus</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Anopheles arabiensis</em>, inside four common house types in rural south-eastern Tanzania.</span> <span style=\"color:#333333\">The assessment was done inside 80 houses including: 20 with thatched roofs and mud walls, 20 with thatched roofs and un-plastered brick walls, 20 with metal roofs and un-plastered brick walls, and 20 with metal roofs and plastered brick walls, across four villages. In each house, resting mosquitoes were sampled in mornings (6&nbsp;a.m.&ndash;8&nbsp;a.m.), evenings (6&nbsp;p.m.&ndash;8&nbsp;p.m.) and at night (11&nbsp;p.m.&ndash;12.00&nbsp;a.m.) using Prokopack aspirators from multiple surfaces (walls, undersides of roofs, floors, furniture, utensils, clothing, curtains and bed nets).</span> <span style=\"color:#333333\">Overall, only 26% of&nbsp;<em>An. funestus</em>&nbsp;and 18% of&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>&nbsp;were found on walls. In grass-thatched houses, 33&ndash;55% of&nbsp;<em>An. funestus</em>&nbsp;and 43&ndash;50% of&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>&nbsp;rested under roofs, while in metal-roofed houses, only 16&ndash;20% of&nbsp;<em>An. funestus</em>&nbsp;and 8&ndash;30% of&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>rested under roofs. Considering all data together, approximately 40% of mosquitoes rested on surfaces not typically targeted by IRS, i.e. floors, furniture, utensils, clothing and bed nets. These proportions were particularly high in metal-roofed houses (47&ndash;53% of&nbsp;<em>An. funestus</em>; 60&ndash;66% of&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>).</span> <span style=\"color:#333333\">While IRS typically uses contact insecticides to target adult mosquitoes on walls, and occasionally roofs and ceilings, significant proportions of vectors rest on surfaces not usually sprayed. This gap exceeds one-third of malaria mosquitoes in grass-thatched houses, and can reach two-thirds in metal-roofed houses. Where field operations exclude roofs during IRS, the gaps can be much greater. In conclusion, there is need for locally-obtained data on mosquito resting behaviours and how these influence the overall impact and costs of IRS. This study also emphasizes the need for alternative approaches, e.g. house screening, which broadly tackle mosquitoes beyond areas reachable by IRS and ITNs.</span></p>"

This study aimed to assess safety, efficacy and optimal timing of single full-dose (0.75&nbsp;mg/kg) primaquine when added to a standard 6-dose regimen of artemether&ndash;lumefantrine (AL).</span> <span style=\"color:#333333\">In an individual-level randomized controlled trial, enrolled participants who were G6PD normal and had uncomplicated&nbsp;<em>P. falciparum</em>&nbsp;malaria were randomly assigned to receive: AL only; AL and a single 0.75&nbsp;mg/kg primaquine dose on the first day of AL (day 1); or AL and single 0.75&nbsp;mg//kg primaquine on the last day of AL (day 3).

        "abstract": "<p>Children from low- and middle-income countries, where there is a high incidence of infectious disease, have the greatest need for the protection afforded by vaccination, but vaccines often show reduced efficacy in these populations. An improved understanding of how age, infection, nutrition, and genetics influence immune ontogeny and function is key to informing vaccine design for this at-risk population. We sought to identify factors that shape immune development in children under 5 years of age from Tanzania and Mozambique by detailed immunophenotyping of longitudinal blood samples collected during the RTS,S malaria vaccine phase 3 trial. In these cohorts, the composition of the immune system is dynamically transformed during the first years of life, and this was further influenced by geographical location, with some immune cell types showing an altered rate of development in Tanzanian children compared to Dutch children enrolled in the Generation R population&ndash;based cohort study. High-titer antibody responses to the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine were associated with an activated immune profile at the time of vaccination, including an increased frequency of antibody-secreting plasmablasts and follicular helper T cells. Anemic children had lower frequencies of recent thymic emigrant T cells, isotype-switched memory B cells, and plasmablasts; modulating iron bioavailability in vitro could recapitulate the B cell defects observed in anemic children. Our findings demonstrate that the composition of the immune system in children varies according to age, geographical location, and anemia status.</p>"

Used tires had highest overall abundance of&nbsp;<em>Ae. aegypti</em>&nbsp;immatures, while coconut tree-holes had highest densities per habitat.&nbsp;<em>Aedes aegypti</em>&nbsp;adults were susceptible to all tested insecticides in both seasons, except bendiocarb, against which resistance was observed in the rainy season.</span> <span style=\"color:#333333\">To our knowledge, this is the first study on ecology and insecticide susceptibility of&nbsp;<em>Ae. aegypti</em>&nbsp;in Ifakara area, and will provide a basis for future studies on its pathogen transmission activities and control.

While used tires, discarded containers and flowerpots are key habitats for&nbsp;<em>Ae. aegypti</em>, this study also identified coconut harvesting as an important risk factor, and the associated tree-holes as potential targets for&nbsp;<em>Aedes</em>&nbsp;control. Since&nbsp;<em>Ae. aegypti</em>&nbsp;mosquitoes in the area are still susceptible to most insecticides, effective control could be achieved by combining environmental management, preferably involving communities, habitat removal and insecticide spraying.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

        "abstract": "<p>Rabies is a neglected zoonotic disease that causes an estimated 59,000 human deaths worldwide annually, mostly in Africa and Asia. A target of zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies has been set for 2030, and large-scale control programs are now advocated. However, in most low-income endemic countries surveillance to guide rabies control is weak and few cases of rabies are recorded. There is an urgent need to enhance surveillance to improve timely case detection and inform rabies control and prevention, by operationalizing a &ldquo;One Health&rdquo; approach. Here we present data from a study piloting Integrated Bite Case Management (IBCM) to support intersectoral collaboration between health and veterinary workers in Tanzania. We trained government staff to implement IBCM, comprising risk assessments of bite patients by health workers, investigations by livestock field officers to diagnose rabid animals, and use of a mobile phone application to support integration. IBCM was introduced across 20 districts in four regions of Tanzania and results reported after 1 year of implementation. Numbers of bite patient presentations to health facilities varied across regions, but following the introduction of IBCM reporting of bite patients at high-risk for rabies more than doubled in all regions. Over 800 high-risk investigations were carried out, with 49% assessed as probable dog rabies cases on the basis of clinical signs, animal outcome, and rapid diagnostic testing. The status of a further 20% of biting animals could not be determined but rabies could not be ruled out. Livestock field officers reported that use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were useful for confirming rabies occurrence. Overall, our study provides further evidence that IBCM is a practical approach that can improve rabies detection in endemic countries, and be used to monitor the impact of mass dog vaccinations, including potential to verify rabies freedom. However, the main challenges to implementation are limited training of health workers in rabies, perceived burden of real-time recording and limited resources for livestock field officers to undertake investigations. Nonetheless, IBCM dramatically improved case detection and communication between sectors and we recommend further implementation research to establish best practice and applicability to other settings.</p>"

Increasing ART coverage in Africa has made it more likely that perinatally and behaviourally HIV-infected children will reach adulthood, but it has not eliminated the burden; instead, the burden has shifted to adolescents.

In phase 1a/1b clinical trials in malaria unexposed adults in Switzerland and in malaria pre-exposed adults in Tanzania, P27A formulated with Alhydrogel and GLA-SE adjuvants induced antigen-specific antibodies and T-cell activity. The GLA-SE adjuvant induced significantly stronger humoral responses than the Alhydrogel adjuvant. Groups of pre-exposed and unexposed subjects received identical vaccine formulations, which supported the comparison of the cellular and humoral response to P27A in terms of fine specificity and affinity for populations and adjuvants. Globally, fine specificity of the T and B cell responses exhibited preferred recognized sequences and did not highlight major differences between adjuvants or populations. Affinity of anti-P27A antibodies was around 10&minus;8&nbsp;M in all groups. Pre-exposed volunteers presented anti-P27A with higher affinity than unexposed volunteers. Increasing the dose of GLA-SE from 2.5 to 5 &mu;g in pre-exposed volunteers improved anti-P27A affinity and decreased the number of recognized epitopes. These results indicate a higher maturation of the humoral response in pre-exposed volunteers, particularly when immunized with P27A formulated with 5 &mu;g GLA-SE.</p>"

Loss to follow\u2010up (LTFU) is typically defined retrospectively but this may lead to biased inferences. We assessed incidence of and factors associated with LTFU, prospectively and accounting for recurrent LTFU episodes, in the Kilombero and Ulanga Antiretroviral Cohort (KIULARCO) of HIV\u2010positive persons in rural Tanzania. We included adults (&ge;15&nbsp;years) enrolled in 2005 to 2016, regardless of ART status, with follow\u2010up through April 2017. LTFU was defined as &gt;60&nbsp;days late for a scheduled appointment. Participants could experience multiple LTFU episodes. We performed analyses based on the first (prospective) and last (retrospective) events observed during follow\u2010up, and accounting for recurrent LTFU episodes. Time to LTFU was estimated using cumulative incidence functions. We assessed factors associated with LTFU using cause\u2010specific proportional hazards, marginal means/rates, and Prentice, Williams and Peterson models. Among 8087 participants (65% female, 60% aged &ge;35&nbsp;years, 42% WHO stage 3/4, and 47% CD4 count &lt;200&nbsp;cells/mm3), there were 8140 LTFU episodes, after which there were 2483 (31%) returns to care. One\u2010year LTFU probabilities were 0.41 (95% confidence interval 0.40, 0.42) and 0.21 (0.20, 0.22) considering the first and last events respectively. Factors associated with LTFU were broadly consistent across different models: being male, younger age, never married, living far from the clinic, not having an HIV\u2010positive partner, lower BMI, advanced WHO stage, not having tuberculosis, and shorter time since ART initiation. Associations between LTFU and pregnancy, CD4 count, and enrolment year depended on the analysis approach. LTFU episodes were common and prompt tracing efforts are urgently needed. We identified socio\u2010demographic and clinical characteristics associated with LTFU that can be used to target tracing efforts and to help inform the design of appropriate interventions. Incidence of and risk factors for LTFU differed based on the LTFU definition applied, highlighting the importance of appropriately accounting for recurrent LTFU episodes. We recommend using a prospective definition of LTFU combined with recurrent event analyses in cohorts where repeated interruptions in care are common.</p>"

This compromises effectiveness of indoor interventions, notably long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). This study characterized common peri-domestic spaces in rural south-eastern Tanzania, and assessed protective efficacy against mosquitoes of hessian fabric mats and ribbons treated with the spatial repellent, transfluthrin, and fitted to chairs and outdoor kitchens, respectively.</span> <span style=\"color:#333333\">Two hundred households were surveyed, and their most-used peri-domestic spaces physically characterized. Protective efficacies of locally-made transfluthrin-emanating chairs and hessian ribbons were tested in outdoor environments of 28 households in dry and wet seasons, using volunteer-occupied exposure-free double net traps. CDC light traps were used to estimate host-seeking mosquito densities within open-structure outdoor kitchens. Field-collected&nbsp;<em>Anopheles arabiensis</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Anopheles funestus</em>&nbsp;mosquitoes were exposed underneath the chairs to estimate 24&nbsp;h-mortality. Finally, The World Health Organization insecticide susceptibility tests were conducted on wild-caught&nbsp;<em>Anopheles</em>&nbsp;from the villages.</span> <span style=\"color:#333333\">Approximately half (52%) of houses had verandas. Aside from these verandas, most houses also had peri-domestic spaces where residents stayed most times (67% of houses with verandas and 94% of non-veranda houses). Two-thirds of these spaces were sited under trees, and only one third (34.4%) were built-up. The outdoor structures were usually makeshift kitchens having roofs and partial walls. Transfluthrin-treated chairs reduced outdoor-biting&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>&nbsp;densities by 70&ndash;85%, while transfluthrin-treated hessian ribbons fitted to the outdoor kitchens caused 77&ndash;81% reduction in the general peri-domestic area. Almost all the field-collected&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>&nbsp;(99.4%) and&nbsp;<em>An. funestus</em>&nbsp;(100%) exposed under transfluthrin-treated chairs died. The&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>&nbsp;were susceptible to non-pyrethroids (pirimiphos methyl and bendiocarb), but resistant to pyrethroids commonly used on LLINs (deltamethrin and permethrin).</span> <span style=\"color:#333333\">Most houses had actively-used peri-domestic outdoor spaces where exposure to mosquitoes occurred. The transfluthrin-treated chairs and ribbons reduced outdoor-biting malaria vectors in these peri-domestic spaces, and also elicited significant mortality among pyrethroid-resistant field-caught malaria vectors. These two new prototype formats for transfluthrin emanators, if developed further, may constitute new options for complementing LLINs and IRS with outdoor protection against malaria and other mosquito-borne pathogens in areas where peri-domestic human activities are common.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

Often, however, the health of the community suffers. Health impact assessment (HIA) can mitigate the risks and promote the benefits of development but is not routinely done in the developing regions that could benefit the most. Our study aims to investigate health and health determinants in regions affected by extractive industries in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mozambique, and Tanzania. The evidence generated in our study will inform a policy dialogue on how HIA can be promoted as a regulatory approach as part of the larger research initiative called the HIA4SD (Health impact assessment for sustainable development) project. The study is a concurrent triangulation, mixed methods, multi-stage, multi-focus project that specifically addresses the topics of governance and policy, social determinants of health, health economics, health systems, maternal and child health, morbidity and mortality, and environmental determinants, as well as the associated health outcomes in natural resource extraction project settings across four countries. To investigate each of these health topics, the project will (1) use existing population-level databases to quantify incidence of disease and other health outcomes and determinants over time using time series analysis; (2) conduct two quantitative surveys on mortality and cost of disease in producer regions; and (3) collect primary qualitative data using focus groups and key informant interviews describing community perceptions of the impacts of extraction projects on health and partnership arrangements between the projects and local and national governance. Differences in health outcomes and health determinants between districts with and without an extraction project will be analyzed using matched geographical analyses in quasi-Poisson regression models and binomial regression models. Costs to the health system and to the households from diseases found to be associated with projects in each country will be estimated retrospectively. Fieldwork for the study began in February 2019 and concluded in February 2020. At the time of submission, qualitative data collection had been completed in all four study countries.

This study explored opinions of key stakeholders on the national progress towards malaria elimination, the potential of currently available vector control interventions in helping achieve elimination by 2030, and the need for alternative interventions that could be used to supplement malaria elimination efforts in Tanzania. In this exploratory qualitative study, Focus group discussions were held with policy-makers, regulators, research scientists and community members. Malaria control interventions discussed were: (a) improved housing, (b) larval source management, (c) mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin to reduce vector densities, (d) release of modified mosquitoes, including genetically modified or irradiated mosquitoes, (e) targeted spraying of mosquito swarms, and (f) spatial repellents. Larval source management and spatial repellents were widely supported across all stakeholder groups, while insecticide-spraying of mosquito swarms was the least preferred. Support for MDA with ivermectin was high among policy makers, regulators and research scientists, but encountered opposition among community members, who instead expressed strong support for programmes to improve housing for poor people in high transmission areas. Policy makers, however, challenged the idea of government-supported housing improvement due to its perceived high costs. Techniques of mosquito modification, specifically those involving gene drives, were viewed positively by community members, policy makers and regulators, but encountered a high degree of scepticism among scientists. Overall, policy-makers, regulators and community members trusted scientists to provide appropriate advice for decision-making. Stakeholder opinions regarding alternative malaria interventions were divergent except for larval source management and spatial repellents, for which there was universal support. MDA with ivermectin, housing improvement and modified mosquitoes were also widely supported, though each faced concerns from at least one stakeholder group. While policy-makers, regulators and community members all noted their reliance on scientists to make informed decisions, their reasoning on the benefits and disadvantages of specific interventions included factors beyond technical efficiency. This study suggests the need to encourage and strengthen dialogue between research scientists, policy makers, regulators and communities regarding new interventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

        "abstract": "<p>Outdoor and early evening mosquito biting needs to be addressed if malaria elimination is to be achieved. While indoor-targeted interventions, such as insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying, remain essential, complementary approaches that tackle persisting outdoor transmission are urgently required to maximize the impact. Major malaria vectors principally bite human hosts around the feet and ankles. Consequently, this study investigated whether sandals treated with efficacious spatial repellents can protect against outdoor biting mosquitoes.&nbsp;Sandals affixed with hessian bands measuring 48&nbsp;cm2&nbsp;treated with 0.06&nbsp;g, 0.10&nbsp;g and 0.15&nbsp;g of transfluthrin were tested in large cage semi-field and full field experiments. Sandals affixed with hessian bands measuring 240&nbsp;cm2&nbsp;and treated with 0.10&nbsp;g and 0.15&nbsp;g of transfluthrin were also tested semi field experiments. Human landing catches (HLC) were used to assess reduction in biting exposure by comparing proportions of mosquitoes landing on volunteers wearing treated and untreated sandals. Sandals were tested against insectary reared&nbsp;<em>Anopheles arabiensis</em>&nbsp;mosquitoes in semi-field experiments and against wild mosquito species in rural Tanzania.&nbsp;In semi-field tests, sandals fitted with hessian bands measuring 48&nbsp;cm2&nbsp;and treated with 0.15&nbsp;g, 0.10&nbsp;g and 0.06&nbsp;g transfluthrin reduced mosquito landings by 45.9%, (95% confidence interval (C.I.) 28&ndash;59%), 61.1% (48&ndash;71%), and 25.9% (9&ndash;40%), respectively compared to untreated sandals. Sandals fitted with hessian bands measuring 240&nbsp;cm2&nbsp;and treated with 0.15&nbsp;g and 0.10&nbsp;g transfluthrin reduced mosquito landings by 59% (43&ndash;71%) and 64% (48&ndash;74%), respectively. In field experiments, sandals fitted with hessian bands measuring 48&nbsp;cm2and treated with 0.15&nbsp;g transfluthrin reduced mosquito landings by 70% (60&ndash;76%) against&nbsp;<em>Anopheles gambiae</em>&nbsp;sensu lato, and 66.0% (59&ndash;71%) against all mosquito species combined.&nbsp;Transfluthrin-treated sandals conferred significant protection against mosquito bites in semi-field and field settings. Further evaluation is recommended for this tool as a potential complementary intervention against malaria. This intervention could be particularly useful for protecting against outdoor exposure to mosquito bites. Additional studies are necessary to optimize treatment techniques and substrates, establish safety profiles and determine epidemiological impact in different settings.</p>"

However, concerns have been raised of potentially harmful cardiotoxic effects associated with piperaquine. The population pharmacokinetics and cardiac effects of piperaquine were evaluated in 1,000 patients, mostly children enrolled in a multicentre trial from 10 sites in Africa. A linear relationship described the QTc-prolonging effect of piperaquine, estimating a 5.90ms mean QTc-prolongation per 100ng/mL increase in piperaquine concentration. The effect of piperaquine on absolute QTc-interval estimated a mean maximum QTc-interval of 456ms (EC50=209ng/mL). Simulations from the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models predicted 1.98-2.46% risk of having QTc-prolongation &gt; 60ms in all treatment settings. Although piperaquine administration resulted in QTc-prolongation, no cardiovascular adverse events were found in these patients. Thus, the use of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine should not be limited by this concern.</p>"

Some aspects of adult mosquito behavior and mosquito ecology play an important role in determining the capacity of vector populations to transmit pathogens. Here, we re-examine factors affecting the transmission of pathogens by mosquitoes using a new approach. Unlike most previous models, this framework considers the behavioral states and state transitions of adult mosquitoes through a sequence of activity bouts. We developed a new framework for individual-based simulation models called MBITES (Mosquito Bout-based and Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator). In MBITES, it is possible to build models that simulate the behavior and ecology of adult mosquitoes in exquisite detail on complex resource landscapes generated by spatial point processes. We also developed an ordinary differential equation model which is the Kolmogorov forward equations for models developed in MBITES under a specific set of simplifying assumptions. While mosquito infection and pathogen development are one possible part of a mosquito&rsquo;s state, that is not our main focus. Using extensive simulation using some models developed in MBITES, we show that vectorial capacity can be understood as an emergent property of simple behavioral algorithms interacting with complex resource landscapes, and that relative density or sparsity of resources and the need to search can have profound consequences for mosquito populations&rsquo; capacity to transmit pathogens.</p>"

Since the implementation of the Tanzania National Voucher Scheme in 2004 and mass-distribution campaigns in 2009&ndash;2011 and 2015&ndash;2016, Tanzania has been committed to finding new and innovative ways of achieving and maintaining universal bed net coverage. Planning for the School Net Programme (SNP) began in 2011 and in 2013, the country piloted a SNP in three regions. Nets were distributed annually to children attending schools in selected primary and secondary grades. Intra-family re-distribution was assumed, and hence the family as a whole, rather than just the children themselves, were the targeted beneficiaries. The programme has since expanded to 14 regions and has seen six rounds of annual distribution. In its fifth year, 3 million nets were distributed at a cost of USD 3.64 per net and USD 0.60 per person-year of protection (including the net). ITN access and use were maintained at a high level (~&thinsp;50&ndash;75%) over the first 4&nbsp;years of distribution within selected evaluation areas, even in the absence of a mass distribution event. Net distribution through primary schools has proven to be a feasible and effective strategy for maintaining consistently high coverage in Tanzania.</p>"

As part of a $79M commitment, the EG government (75%) and three American energy companies (25%) have invested since 2012 greater than $55M in the Equatoguinean Malaria Vaccine Initiative (EGMVI) to support clinical development of Sanaria&reg;&nbsp;PfSPZ vaccines. In turn, the vaccine development program is building human capital and physical capacity. The EGMVI established regulatory and ethical oversight to ensure compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization and Good Clinical Practices for the first importation of investigational product, ethical approval, and conduct of a clinical trial in Equatoguinean history. The Equatoguinean Malaria Vaccine Initiative has completed three vaccine trials in EG, two vaccine trials in Tanzania, and a malaria incidence study, and initiated preparations for a 2,100-volunter clinical trial. Personnel are training for advanced degrees abroad and have been trained in Good Clinical Practices and protocol-specific methods. A new facility has established the foundation for a national research institute.

We evaluated one-third million insect observations during five nights, four days, and one annular solar eclipse. We demonstrate in situ lidar classification of several insect families and their sexes based on their modulation signatures. We were able to compare the fine-scale spatiotemporal activity patterns of malaria vectors during ordinary days and an eclipse to disentangle phototactic activity patterns from the circadian mechanism. We observed an increased insect activity during the eclipse attributable to mosquitoes.

Researchers screened search results for papers using predefined criteria. Papers included in the review were read and summarised using a standardised proforma. Descriptive statistics were produced to characterise the location of the studies, art forms used or discussed, and the health issues addressed, and to determine how best to summarise the literature identified.&nbsp;Searches identified a total of 59&thinsp;794 records, which reduced to 119 after screening. We identified literature representing 30 (62.5%) of the 48 countries in the SSA region. The papers covered 16 health issues. The majority (84.9%) focused on HIV/AIDS-related work, with Ebola (5.0%) and malaria (3.3%) also receiving attention. Most studies used a single art form (79.0%), but a significant number deployed multiple forms (21.0%). Theatre-based approaches were most common (43.7%), followed by music and song (22.6%), visual arts (other) (9.2%), storytelling (7.6%) and film (5.0%).&nbsp;Arts-based approaches have been widely deployed in health promotion in SSA, particularly in response to HIV/AIDS. Historically and as evidenced by this review, arts-based approaches have provided a platform to facilitate enquiry, achieved significant reach and in some instances supported demonstrable health-related change. Challenges relating to content, power relations and evaluation have been reported. Future research should focus on broadening application to other conditions, such as non-communicable diseases, and on addressing challenges raised in research to date.</p>"

There was an increase in DM prevalence in patients 50&ndash;59 (14.9%; 95%&thinsp;CI 9.1 to 22.5), &ge;60 years old (18.5%; 95%&thinsp;CI 12.2 to 26.2) and in patients with overweight (9.3%; 95%&thinsp;CI 5.9 to 13.7), obesity (10.9%; 95%&thinsp;CI 6.9 to 16) compared with patients 18&ndash;29 years old (2.2%; 95%&thinsp;CI 0.9 to 4.4) (p&lt;0.001) and to normal-weight patients (3.6%; 95%&thinsp;CI 2.1 to 5.6) (p&lt;0.01), respectively. Age (OR 1.08, 95%&thinsp;CI 1.05 to 1.12; p&lt;0.001), body mass index (BMI) (OR 1.10, 95%&thinsp;CI 1.04 to 1.16; p&lt;0.001), and acute infection (OR 3.46, 95%&thinsp;CI 1.02 to 10.8; p=0.038) were predictors for DM. Comparing patients with a BMI of 20&thinsp;kg/m2&nbsp;and a BMI of 35&thinsp;kg/m2, the relative risk for DM increases in average by 2.12-fold (range 1.91&ndash;2.24) across the age groups. Comparing patients 20 years old with patients 70 years old, the relative risk for DM increases in average 9.7-fold (range 8.9&ndash;10.4) across the BMI groups. Overall, 333 patients (36%) suffered from anemia. Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficients (r) between HbA1c and hemoglobin was &minus;0.009 (p=0.779), and between HbA1c and fasting blood glucose and random blood glucose, it was 0.775 and 0.622, respectively (p&lt;0.001). We observed a high prevalence of DM and pre-DM, mainly triggered by increasing age and BMI, and provide evidence that HbA1c is suitable to assess DM also in populations of SSA with high proportions of anemia</p>"

        "abstract": "<p>The United Nation&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goal number 3 aims at reducing the maternal mortality rate by less than 70/100,000 live births globally and 216/100,000 live births in developing regions by 2030. Despite several interventions in Tanzania, maternal mortality has increased from 454/100,000 live births in 2010 to 556/100,000 live births in 2015. Home delivery and maternal young age contribute to maternal deaths. Reducing home deliveries among women aged 15-24 years may likely decrease the prevalence of maternal deaths in Tanzania. This study investigated the determinants of home delivery among women aged 15- 24 years in rural and mainland districts of Tanzania. This study uses a mixed-methods approach using data collected as part of the evaluation of government and UNICEF interventions in 13 districts of Tanzania mainland from October and November 2011. Results from the secondary analysis were supplemented by qualitative data collected between February and April 2019 from four rural districts: Bagamoyo, Tandahimba, Magu, and Moshi.&nbsp;A total of 409 adolescents and young women who delivered one year before the quantitative data collection were included in the final analysis. A quarter of them gave birth at home. Having at least four antenatal care (ANC) visits (OR=0.23, 95% CI: 0.12-0.41, p&lt;0.01), planning place of delivery (OR=0.22, 95%CI: 0.14-0.36 p&lt;0.01), and knowledge of the danger signs during pregnancy (OR=0.36, 95% CI: 0.22- 0.57, p&lt;0.01) were significantly associated with the place of delivery.&nbsp;Maternal level of education, number of ANC visits attended, planned place of delivery, and knowledge of danger signs during pregnancy were the determinants of the choice of place of delivery among women aged 15-24 years in Tanzania. Understanding these risk factors is important in designing programs and interventions to reduce maternal deaths from women of this age group which contributes about 18% of all maternal deaths in Tanzania.</p>"

We identified both preimmunization and postimmunization transcriptomic signatures correlating with protection. Signatures were validated in independent children and infants from the RTS,S/AS01E phase 3 trial and individuals from an independent CPS trial with high accuracies (&gt;70%). Transcription modules revealed interferon, NF-&kappa;B, Toll-like receptor (TLR), and monocyte-related signatures associated with protection. Preimmunization signatures suggest that priming the immune system before vaccination could potentially improve vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. Last, signatures of protection could be useful to determine efficacy in clinical trials, accelerating vaccine candidate testing. Nevertheless, signatures should be tested more extensively across multiple cohorts and trials to demonstrate their universal predictive capacity.</p>"

UPSIDES-RCT is a pragmatic, parallel-group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of using peer support in developing empowering mental health services (UPSIDES) at four measurement points over 1 year (baseline, 4-, 8- and 12-month follow-up), with embedded process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis. Research will take place in a range of high-, middle- and low-income countries (Germany, UK, Israel, India, Uganda and Tanzania). The primary outcome is social inclusion of service users with severe mental illness (<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;558;&nbsp;<em>N</em>&thinsp;=&thinsp;93 per site) at 8-month follow-up, measured with the Social Inclusion Scale. Secondary outcomes include empowerment (using the Empowerment Scale), hope (using the HOPE scale), recovery (using Stages of Recovery) and health and social functioning (using the Health of the Nations Outcome Scales). Mixed-methods process evaluation will investigate mediators and moderators of effect and the implementation experiences of four UPSIDES stakeholder groups (service users, peer support workers, mental health workers and policy makers). A cost-effectiveness analysis examining cost-utility and health budget impact will estimate the value for money of UPSIDES peer support. The UPSIDES-RCT will explore the essential components necessary to create a peer support model in mental health care, while providing the evidence required to sustain and eventually scale-up the intervention in different cultural, organisational and resource settings. By actively involving and empowering service users, UPSIDES will move mental health systems toward a recovery orientation, emphasising user-centredness, community participation and the realisation of mental health as a human right.</h3>"

We assessed the compliance of health workers with infection prevention and control practices relevant to COVID-19 in outpatient settings in Tanzania, before the pandemic.&nbsp;This study was based on a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected as part of a randomised controlled trial in private for-profit dispensaries and health centres and in faith-based dispensaries, health centres, and hospitals, in 18 regions. We observed provider&ndash;patient interactions in outpatient consultation rooms, laboratories, and dressing rooms, and categorised infection prevention and control practices into four domains: hand hygiene, glove use, disinfection of reusable equipment, and waste management. We calculated compliance as the proportion of indications (infection risks) in which a health worker performed a correct action, and examined associations between compliance and health worker and facility characteristics using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models.&nbsp;Between Feb 7 and April 5, 2018, we visited 228 health facilities, and observed at least one infection prevention and control indication in 220 facilities (118 [54%] dispensaries, 66 [30%] health centres, and 36 [16%] hospitals). 18710 indications were observed across 734 health workers (49 [7%] medical doctors, 214 [29%] assistant medical officers or clinical officers, 106 [14%] nurses or midwives, 126 [17%] clinical assistants, and 238 [32%] laboratory technicians or assistants). Compliance was 6&middot;9% for hand hygiene (n=8655 indications), 74&middot;8% for glove use (n=4915), 4&middot;8% for disinfection of reusable equipment (n=841), and 43&middot;3% for waste management (n=4299). Facility location was not associated with compliance in any of the infection prevention and control domains. Facility level and ownership were also not significantly associated with compliance, except for waste management. For hand hygiene, nurses and midwives (odds ratio 5&middot;80 [95% CI 3&middot;91&ndash;8&middot;61]) and nursing and medical assistants (2&middot;65 [1&middot;67&ndash;4&middot;20]) significantly outperformed the reference category of assistant medical officers or clinical officers.

Health worker age was negatively associated with correct glove use and female health workers were more likely to comply with hand hygiene.&nbsp;Health worker infection prevention and control compliance, particularly for hand hygiene and disinfection, was inadequate in these outpatient settings.

        "abstract": "<p>Over the last decade, performance-based financing (PBF) has gained momentum as a health financing innovation, which combines linking healthcare payments to performance with increased provider autonomy and supervision. The combination of these elements is expected to boost supply-side efforts towards increasing quantity and quality of service provision, triggering a demand-side response towards improved service utilisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent paper by Paul <em>et al</em> has critically questioned the widespread introduction of PBF in light of the limited available evidence on its effectiveness. The response to this paper has been varied, with authors advancing arguments for and against PBF. Some African PBF implementers have claimed that PBF is an evolving strategy with potential benefits on health systems despite its existing challenges. Others have drawn attention to the unintended consequences of PBF<a class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"https://gh.bmj.com/content/5/8/e003136#ref-7\" id=\"xref-ref-7-1\">7</a> or to the need to assess the economic value of such an approach. Beyond their diverse arguments, however, most authors have concurred with Paul <em>et al</em> on the limited scope of currently available evidence and have postulated the need to better assess how PBF works under different contextual constraints within and across settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our commentary positions itself against this background, acknowledges the limited scope of current evidence on PBF, and explicitly argues in favour of devoting more effort to unravel heterogeneity across and within settings. Our argument is based on the recognition that by virtue of how impact evaluations are designed, the focus has been on the average effect, which masks important heterogeneity across settings, providers and users. To date, only a handful of studies have assessed heterogeneity of PBF effects across population subgroups or across health providers. Similarly, little attention has been devoted to understanding which factors can explain heterogeneity in the response to PBF or why PBF stimulates changes in some instances, but not in others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In light of the above, we call for more systematic analyses of heterogeneity, defined in relation to both the need to report differential effects and the need to understand what drives or explains such differential effects within and across settings. We first define and outline potential sources of heterogeneity and then offer initial guidance on how to measure and understand heterogeneity.</p>"

        "abstract": "<p>After mating, female mosquitoes need animal blood to develop their eggs. In the process of acquiring blood, they may acquire pathogens, which may cause different diseases in humans such as malaria, zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Therefore, knowing the parity status of mosquitoes is useful in control and evaluation of infectious diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, where parous mosquitoes are assumed to be potentially infectious. Ovary dissections, which are currently used to determine the parity status of mosquitoes, are very tedious and limited to few experts. An alternative to ovary dissections is near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which can estimate the age in days and the infectious state of laboratory and semi-field reared mosquitoes with accuracies between 80 and 99%. No study has tested the accuracy of NIRS for estimating the parity status of wild mosquitoes. In this study, we train an artificial neural network (ANN) models on NIR spectra to estimate the parity status of wild mosquitoes. We use four different datasets:&nbsp;<em>An</em>.&nbsp;<em>arabiensis</em>&nbsp;collected from Minepa, Tanzania (Minepa-ARA);&nbsp;<em>An</em>.&nbsp;<em>gambiae s</em>.<em>s</em>&nbsp;collected from Muleba, Tanzania (Muleba-GA);&nbsp;<em>An</em>.&nbsp;<em>gambiae s</em>.<em>s</em>&nbsp;collected from Burkina Faso (Burkina-GA); and&nbsp;<em>An</em>.<em>gambiae s</em>.<em>s</em>&nbsp;from Muleba and Burkina Faso combined (Muleba-Burkina-GA). We train ANN models on datasets with spectra preprocessed according to previous protocols. We then use autoencoders to reduce the spectra feature dimensions from 1851 to 10 and re-train the ANN models. Before the autoencoder was applied, ANN models estimated parity status of mosquitoes in Minepa-ARA, Muleba-GA, Burkina-GA and Muleba-Burkina-GA with out-of-sample accuracies of 81.9&plusmn;2.8 (N = 274), 68.7&plusmn;4.8 (N = 43), 80.3&plusmn;2.0 (N = 48), and 75.7&plusmn;2.5 (N = 91), respectively. With the autoencoder, ANN models tested on out-of-sample data achieved 97.1&plusmn;2.2% (N = 274), 89.8 &plusmn; 1.7% (N = 43), 93.3&plusmn;1.2% (N = 48), and 92.7&plusmn;1.8% (N = 91) accuracies for Minepa-ARA, Muleba-GA, Burkina-GA, and Muleba-Burkina-GA, respectively. These results show that a combination of an autoencoder and an ANN trained on NIR spectra to estimate the parity status of wild mosquitoes yields models that can be used as an alternative tool to estimate parity status of wild mosquitoes, especially since NIRS is a high-throughput, reagent-free, and simple-to-use technique compared to ovary dissections.</p>"

        "abstract": "<p>Reliable sources of CO2&nbsp;that are relatively cheap, obtainable, and easy to sustain are immediately required for scaling up of odor-baited mosquito surveillance and control devices. Several odor-baited devices are in the pipeline; however, their scale-up against residual malaria transmission, particularly in resource poor areas, is limited by the unavailability of reliable sources of CO2&nbsp;and reliance on electrical power sources among other factors. We evaluated the use of granular cyclopentanone as an alternative to artificial or yeast fermentation-produced CO2&nbsp;in passive outdoor host seeking device (POHD). Experiments were conducted against semifield reared&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>&nbsp;within the semifield system (SFS) at Ifakara Health Institute. Mosquitoes were tested against odor-baited POHDs augmented with yeast fermentation-produced CO2, granular cyclopentanone, attractive blends (Mbita or Ifakara), or their combinations. An insecticide, bendiocarb, was a killing agent used as a proxy for marking the mosquitoes visit the POHDs. Relative attractiveness of different treatment combinations was compared based on the proportion of dead mosquitoes that visited the POHD. The POHD augmented with granules of cyclopentanone alone was attractive to&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>&nbsp;as much as, or more than, POHDs augmented with yeast fermentation-produced CO2. The POHD baited with CO2&nbsp;attracted more mosquitoes than those POHDs baited with synthetic blends alone; when these blends are combined with CO2, they attracted more mosquitoes than individual blends. More importantly, such POHDs baited with cyclopentanone attracted far greater proportion of mosquitoes than the POHD baited with either Mbita or Ifakara blend alone. The granular cyclopentanone strongly enhanced/potentiated the attractiveness of POHD baited with Mbita blends against mosquitoes compared to that of POHD baited with Ifakara blend. Moreover, the granular cyclopentanone retained its residual activity against&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>&nbsp;for up to 2 months after application particularly when used in combination with Mbita blend. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that cyclopentanone granules have the potential to substitute sources of CO2&nbsp;in outdoor-based surveillance and control devices, thus warranting evaluation of such alternative under realistic field conditions.</p>"

        "abstract": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Introduction</em>. Pregnant women are at a high risk of anaemia, with iron-folate deficiency being the most common cause of anaemia among pregnant women. Despite the well-known importance of iron and folic acid supplementation (IFAS) during pregnancy, adherence to these supplements is relatively low and associated factors were not well identified in the study area. This study is aimed at investigating adherence to IFAS and associated factors among pregnant women in Kasulu district, north-western Tanzania.&nbsp;<em>Methods.</em>&nbsp;A health facility cross-sectional survey with a mixed-method approach was conducted in Kasulu district from March to April 2019. A structured questionnaire was given to 320 women with children aged 0-6 months to assess factors associated with adherence to IFAS among pregnant women. Data were entered into SPSS version 22.0 for analysis. Binary logistic regression was further employed to determine the factors associated with adherence to IFAS. Focus group discussions were done with 19 pregnant women and 15 mothers of children aged 0-6 months to obtain more clarifications on the factors associated with adherence to IFAS. Furthermore, in-depth interviews were done with six health care providers to explore their perceptions of IFAS.&nbsp;<em>Results</em>. Out of the 320 respondents of the survey, 20.3% ()&nbsp;adhered to IFAS. Factors associated with adherence to IFAS among pregnant women included time to start ANC (,&nbsp;95% CI: 1.42, 9.79), knowledge of anaemia (,&nbsp;95% CI: 1.335, 10.66), counseling on the importance of the iron-folic acid (,&nbsp;95% CI: 1.42, 10.50), IFAS given during clinical visit (,&nbsp;95% CI: 5.34, 46.31), number of meals consumed (,&nbsp;95% CI: 1.28, 9.21), number of children (,&nbsp;95% CI: 1.035, 11.58), and distance to health facility (,&nbsp;95% CI: 0.131, 0.886). Qualitative findings revealed that delayed first ANC visit, lack of remainder for pregnant women to take IFAS, low awareness about the negative effects of anaemia, low of knowledge of IFAS and management of side effects, negative beliefs about the use of IFAS, and follow-up mechanism were major reasons for poor adherence.&nbsp;<em>Conclusion</em>. Adherence to iron-folic acid supplementation during pregnancy was low. Strengthening systems for creating reminding mechanism, raising community awareness through educational programs to pregnant women and health providers could improve adherence to IFAS</p>"

It was trained on data from a large longitudinal study conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and has been shown to accurately identify cervices with early stages of cervical neoplasia for clinical evaluation and treatment. The algorithm processes images of the uterine cervix taken with a digital camera and alerts the user if the woman is a candidate for further evaluation. This requires that the algorithm be presented with images of the cervix, which is the object of interest, of acceptable quality, i.e., in sharp focus, with good illumination, without shadows or other occlusions, and showing the entire squamo-columnar transformation zone. Our prior work has addressed some of these constraints to help discard images that do not meet these criteria. In this work, we present a novel algorithm that determines that the image contains the cervix to a sufficient extent. Non-cervix or other inadequate images could lead to suboptimal or wrong results. Manual removal of such images is labor intensive and time-consuming, particularly in working with large retrospective collections acquired with inadequate quality control. In this work, we present a novel ensemble deep learning method to identify cervix images and non-cervix images in a smartphone-acquired cervical image dataset. The ensemble method combined the assessment of three deep learning architectures, RetinaNet, Deep SVDD, and a customized CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), each using a different strategy to arrive at its decision, i.e., object detection, one-class classification, and binary classification. We examined the performance of each individual architecture and an ensemble of all three architectures. An average accuracy and F-1 score of 91.6% and 0.890, respectively, were achieved on a separate test dataset consisting of more than 30,000 smartphone-captured images</p>"

However, the odor-baited devices developed so far are bulky, dependent on the source of electricity and carbon dioxide (CO2), and they are logistically unsuitable for scaling up in surveillance and control of malaria vectors. We designed a passive and portable outdoor host seeking device (POHD) and preliminarily evaluated suitable components against&nbsp;<em>Anopheles arabiensis</em>&nbsp;that maintains residual malaria transmission. Experiments were conducted using semifield reared&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>&nbsp;within the semifield system at Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in southeastern Tanzania. These mosquitoes were exposed to Suna traps&reg; baited with BG lures or source of light and augmented with carbon dioxide (CO2) in view of identifying best attractants necessary to improve attractiveness of designed POHD. Two Suna traps&reg; were hanged at the corner but outside the experimental hut in a diagonal line and rotated between four corners to control for the effect of position and wind direction on mosquito catches. Furthermore, mosquitoes were also exposed to either a bendiocarb-treated or bendiocarb-untreated POHD baited with Mbita blend, Ifakara blend, and worn socks and augmented with warmth (i.e., 1.5&thinsp;liter bottle of warm water) inside an experimental hut or a screened rectangular box. This study demonstrated that mosquitoes were more strongly attracted to Suna trap&reg; baited with BG lures and CO2&nbsp;relative to those traps baited with a source of light and CO2. The POHD baited with synthetic blends attracted and killed greater proportion of&nbsp;<em>An. arabiensis</em>&nbsp;compared with POHD baited with worn socks. Efficacy of the POHD was unaffected by source of warmth, and it was reduced by about 50% when the device was tested inside a screened rectangular box relative to closed experimental hut. Overall, this study demonstrates that the POHD baited with synthetic blends (Mbita and Ifakara blends) and bendiocarb can effectively attract and kill outdoor biting malaria vector species. Such POHD baited with synthetic blends may require the source of CO2&nbsp;to enhance attractiveness to mosquitoes. Further trials are, therefore, ongoing to evaluate attractiveness of improved design of POHD baited with slow-release formulation of synthetic blends and sustainable source of CO2&nbsp;to malaria vectors under semifield and natural environments.</p>"

The predictions of these models illustrate (1) why ambitious lock-down interventions to&nbsp;<em>crush the curve</em>&nbsp;represent the only realistic way for individual countries to contain their national-level epidemics before they turn into outright catastrophes, (2) why these need to be implemented so early, so stringently and for such extended periods, (3) why high prevalence of other pathogens causing similar symptoms to mild COVID-19 precludes the use of contact tracing as a substitute for lock down interventions to contain and eliminate epidemics, (4) why partial containment strategies intended to merely&nbsp;<em>flatten the curve</em>, by maintaining epidemics at manageably low levels, are grossly unrealistic, and (5) why local elimination may only be sustained after lock down ends if imported cases are comprehensively excluded, so international co-operation to conditionally re-open trade and travel between countries certified as free of COVID-19 represents the best strategy for motivating progress towards pandemic eradication at global level. The three sequential goals that every country needs to emphatically embrace are&nbsp;<em>contain</em>,&nbsp;<em>eliminate</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>exclude</em>. As recently emphasized by the World Health Organization, success will require widespread&nbsp;<em>genuine national unity</em>&nbsp;and unprecedented&nbsp;<em>global solidarity</em>.</p>"

In-depth interviews were conducted with 25 health workers, 66 female service users and 10 male partners in Ifakara (Tanzania), Karonga (Malawi) and uMkhanyakude (South Africa) to elicit experiences of offering, providing or receiving HIV care in the context of antenatal care. Data were coded inductively and analysed thematically. Participants reported benefits of couple testing during antenatal care, including facilitated HIV status disclosure and mutual support for HIV care-seeking. However, unintended consequences included women attending without partners, being refused or delayed access to antenatal services. Some women were required to obtain letters from village leaders to justify the absence of their partners, again to delaying or disrupting care-seeking. When partners attended antenatal care, consultations were reportedly more likely to focus on HIV testing, and less on antenatal or neonatal care. Strategies to increase men&rsquo;s attendance at HIV clinics with their partners can promote mutual support within couples for HIV care engagement, but may risk undermining engagement in pregnancy and HIV care for some women if over-stringently applied. Efforts are needed to address the underlying pervasive stigma associated with HIV care, both alone and as a couple.</p>"

A recent study demonstrated that the potency of the Nobivac&reg;&nbsp;Canine Rabies vaccine was not impacted following experimental storage at 30 &deg;C for three months. We conducted a study to develop a passive cooling device (PCD) that could store thermotolerant vaccines under fluctuating subambient temperatures. Through a participatory process with local communities in Northern Tanzania, we developed innovative PCD designs for local manufacture. A series of field experiments were then carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of five PCDs for vaccine storage under varying climatic conditions. Following iterative improvement, a final prototype &ldquo;Zeepot Clay&rdquo; was developed at the cost of US$11 per unit. During a further field-testing phase over a 12-month period, the internal temperature of the device remained below 26 &deg;C, despite ambient temperatures exceeding 42 &deg;C. Our study thus demonstrated that locally designed PCDs have utility for storing thermotolerant rabies vaccines at subambient temperatures. These results have application for the scaling up of mass dog vaccination programs in low-and-middle income countries, particularly for hard-to-reach populations with limited access to power and cold-chain vaccine storage.</p>"

We aimed to assess mortality in a clinical cohort (KIULARCO) of HIV-infected persons in rural Tanzania, accounting for unseen deaths among participants LTFU. We included adults enrolled in 2005-2015 and traced a non-random sample of those LTFU. We estimated mortality using Kaplan-Meier methods with: A) routinely-captured data; B) crudely incorporating tracing data; C) weighting using tracing data to crudely correct for unobserved deaths among participants LTFU; and D) weighting using tracing data accounting for participant characteristics. We investigated associated factors using proportional hazards models. Among 7460 adults, 646 (9%) died, 883 (12%) transferred clinics, and 2911 (39%) were LTFU. Of 2010 (69%) traced participants, 325 (16%) were found: 131 (40%) died and 130 (40%) transferred. Five-year mortality estimates were A) 13.1%; B) 16.2%; C) 36.8%; D) 35.1%. Higher mortality was associated with male sex, referral as hospital in-patient, living close to the clinic, lower body mass index, more advanced WHO stage, lower CD4 count, and less time since antiretroviral therapy initiation. Adjusting for unseen deaths among participants LTFU approximately doubled the five-year mortality estimates. Our approach is applicable to other cohorts adopting targeted tracing#</p>"

Recent data shows significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro by ivermectin concentrations not achievable with safe doses orally. Inhaled therapy has been used with success for other antiparasitics. An ethanol-based ivermectin formulation was administered once to 14 rats using a nebulizer capable of delivering particles with alveolar deposition. Rats were randomly assigned into three target dosing groups, lower dose (80&ndash;90&nbsp;mg/kg), higher dose (110&ndash;140&nbsp;mg/kg) or ethanol vehicle only. A toxicology profile including behavioral and weight monitoring, full blood count, biochemistry, necropsy and histological examination of the lungs was conducted. The pharmacokinetic profile of ivermectin in plasma and lungs was determined in all animals. There were no relevant changes in behavior or body weight. There was a delayed elevation in muscle enzymes compatible with rhabdomyolysis, that was also seen in the control group and has been attributed to the ethanol dose which was up to 11&nbsp;g/kg in some animals. There were no histological anomalies in the lungs of any rat. Male animals received a higher ivermectin dose adjusted by adipose weight and reached higher plasma concentrations than females in the same dosing group (mean Cmax&nbsp;86.2&nbsp;ng/ml vs. 26.2&nbsp;ng/ml in the lower dose group and 152&nbsp;ng/ml vs. 51.8&nbsp;ng/ml in the higher dose group).

        "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When seeking a human for a blood meal, mosquitoes use several cues to detect and find their hosts. From this knowledge, counter-flow odour-baited traps have been developed that use a combination of CO2, human-mimicking odour, visual cues and circulating airflow to attract and capture mosquitoes. Initially developed for monitoring, these traps are now also being considered as promising vector control tools. The traps are attractive to host-seeking mosquitoes, but their capture efficiency is low. It has been hypothesized that the lack of short-range host cues, such as heat and increased local humidity, often prevent mosquitoes from getting close enough to get caught; this lack might even trigger avoidance manoeuvres near the capture region.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Methods</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This study investigated how close-range host cues affect the flight behaviour of&nbsp;<em>Anopheles</em>&nbsp;female malaria mosquitoes around odour-baited traps, and how this affects trap capture performance. For this, a novel counter-flow odour-baited trap was developed, the M-Tego. In addition to the usual CO2&nbsp;and odour-blend, this trap can provide the short-range host cues, heat and humidity. Systematically adding or removing these two cues tested how this affected the trap capture percentages and flight behaviour. First, capture percentages of the M-Tego with and without short-range host cues to the BG-Suna trap were compared, in both laboratory and semi-field testing. Then, machine-vision techniques were used to track the three-dimensional flight movements of mosquitoes around the M-Tego.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With heat and humidity present, the M-Tego captured significantly more mosquitoes as capture percentages almost doubled. Comparing the flight behaviour around the M-Tego with variable close-range host cues showed that when these cues were present, flying mosquitoes were more attracted to the trap and spent more time there. In addition, the M-Tego was found to have a better capture mechanism than the BG-Suna, most likely because it does not elicit previously observed upward avoiding manoeuvres.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Results suggest that adding heat and humidity to an odour-baited trap lures more mosquitoes close to the trap and retains them there longer, resulting in higher capture performance. These findings support the development of control tools for fighting mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria.</p>"

Facility data were obtained from several secondary sources. The proportion of the variance in facility improvement observed at facility and district levels and the influence of nearby facilities and district administration were estimated using multilevel regression models and a hierarchal spatial autoregressive model, respectively. Findings Star ratings improved at 4028 of 5595 (72%) primary care facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Factors associated with improvement included: (i) star rating in 2015; (ii) facility type (e.g. hospital) and ownership (e.g. public); (iii) participation in, or eligibility for, a results-based financing programme; (iv) local population density; and (v) distance from a major road. Overall, 20% of the variance in facility improvement was associated with district administration. Geographical clustering indicated that improvement at a facility was also associated with improvements at nearby facilities. Conclusion Although the majority of facilities improved their star rating, there were substantial variations between facilities. Both district administration and proximity to high-performing facilities influenced improvements. Quality improvement interventions should take advantage of factors operating above the facility level, such as peer learning and peer pressure.#</p>"

        "abstract": "<p>Climate change is expected to increase the prevalence of water-borne diseases especially in developing countries. Climate-resilient drinking water supplies are critical to protect communities from faecal contamination and thus against increasing disease risks. However, no quantitative assessment exists for the impacts of short-term climate variability on faecal contamination at different drinking water sources in developing countries, while existing understanding remains largely conceptual. This critical gap limits the ability to predict drinking water quality under climate change or to recommend climate-resilient water sources for vulnerable communities. This study aims to provide such quantitative understanding by investigating the relationships between faecal contamination and short-term climate variability across different types of water sources. We collected a novel dataset with over 20&nbsp;months&#39; monitoring of weather,&nbsp;<em>Escherichia coli</em>&nbsp;(<em>E. coli</em>) and total coliforms, at 233 different water sources in three climatically different regions in Tanzania. We then took a rigorous statistical analysis with Bayesian hierarchical models, to relate both contamination occurrence and amount to climate variability. The model results explained the temporal variability in drinking water faecal contamination using climate predictors, and also revealed the climate sensitivity of faecal contamination for individual water sources. We found that: a) short-term climate variability and baseline contamination levels can explain about half the observed variability in faecal contamination (R2&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0.44); b) increased contamination was most consistently related to recent heavy rainfall and high temperature across different water sources; c) unimproved water sources such as the unprotected dug wells have substantially higher climate sensitivity. Based on these results, we can expect substantial increases in drinking water contamination risks across tropical Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asian developing countries under a warmer climate, which highlight the urgent need of protecting vulnerable communities from the severe climate impacts.</p>"

The findings will be useful for the provision of tailored interventions focused on community-specific nutritional and behavioral practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Methods</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We conducted a community based cross-sectional study involving a sample of 510 adults aged above 18&thinsp;years selected using a multistage cluster sampling in the Monduli district of Arusha region, Tanzania. Data were collected by using interviewer-administered questionnaires containing socio-demographic, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption. Anthropometry, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels were measured. A one-day 24&thinsp;h diet recall was conducted to evaluate the dietary habits of all participants. Both linear and logistic regression analysis were used to identify the independent predictors for hypertension and blood pressure levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The prevalence of hypertension in this study was 25.7% (<em>n&thinsp;=</em>&nbsp;131, 95% CI; 22.1&ndash;29.7). The odds of hypertension increased with being male (AOR&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.75, 95%CI, 1.06&ndash;2.88), belonging to the older age group of 30&ndash;39&thinsp;year olds (AOR&thinsp;=&thinsp;3.3, 95%CI, 1.76&ndash;6.38), 40&ndash;59&thinsp;year olds (AOR&thinsp;=&thinsp;3.34, 95%CI, 1.75&ndash;6.37) and&thinsp;&ge;&thinsp;60&thinsp;year olds (AOR&thinsp;=&thinsp;4.2, 95%CI, 2.02&ndash;8.87), being overweight or obese (AOR&thinsp;=&thinsp;3.37, 95%CI, 1.18&ndash;9.62), have more hours spent sedentary (AOR&thinsp;=&thinsp;3.19, 95%CI, 1.61&ndash;6.32), and consumption of fatty foods (AOR&thinsp;=&thinsp;2.23, 95%CI, 1.27&ndash;3.93). The odds for hypertension was significantly reduced among participants who reported higher income (AOR&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.47, 95% CI, 0.25&ndash;0.91), high level of physical activity (AOR&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.55, 95%CI, 0.31&ndash;0.96) and those reported to consume fruit (AOR&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.37, 95% CI, 0.18&ndash;0.77). Consumption of cereals was negatively associated with levels of SBP (&beta;&thinsp;=&thinsp;&minus;&thinsp;17.4, 95% CI, &minus;&thinsp;23.8; &minus;&thinsp;11.0) and DBP (&beta;&thinsp;=&thinsp;&minus;&thinsp;6.6, 95% CI, &minus;&thinsp;11.5,-1.79).</p>"

An evidence-to-policy plan identified key opportunities and stakeholders to target to facilitate the use of results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The total annual economic cost of the immunization program, inclusive of vaccines, was estimated to be US$138 million (95% CI: 133, 144), or $4.32 ($3.72, $4.98) per dose. The delivery costs made up $45 million (38, 52), or $1.38 (1.06, 1.70) per dose. The costs of facility-based delivery were similar in urban and rural areas, but the costs of outreach delivery were higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The facility-level delivery cost per dose decreased with the facility service delivery volume</p>"

The public release of this report by drug monitoring authorities led to uncertainty about the use of dolutegravir-based regimen among women of reproductive potential.

First, it is currently unknown whether the increased risk of developing excess weight gain among ART-na&iuml;ve patients starting a dolutegravir-based regimen will be observed also sub-Saharan African settings, specifically in rural environments, where the living conditions and comorbidities might be quite different. The risk factors for developing excessive weight gain include black ethnicity, being a woman, low CD4 count and high HIV viral load [<a href=\"https://www.panafrican-med-journal.com/content/article/37/243/full/#ref4\">4</a>,<a href=\"https://www.panafrican-med-journal.com/content/article/37/243/full/#ref5\">5</a>]. This is of particular concern since in sub-Saharan Africa, majority of PLHIV are women, and still patients present to the health care facilities with advanced HIV disease with low CD4 count, and high HIV viral load. Second, PLHIV with viral suppression from older ART regimen such as NNRTI have an increased risk of developing excess weight gain once switched to dolutegravir-based regimen [<a href=\"https://www.panafrican-med-journal.com/content/article/37/243/full/#ref4\">4</a>].

It is an approach that is increasingly used to support health system strengthening, which is widely promoted in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, few QI initiatives are sustained and implementation is poorly understood. Here, we propose realist evaluation to fill this gap, sharing an example from southern Tanzania. We use realist evaluation to generate insights around the mechanisms driving QI implementation. These insights can be harnessed to maximize capacity strengthening in QI and to support its operationalization, thus contributing to health systems strengthening. Realist evaluation begins by establishing an initial programme theory, which is presented here. We generated this through an elicitation approach, in which multiple sources (theoretical literature, a document review and previous project reports) were collated and analysed retroductively to generate hypotheses about how the QI intervention is expected to produce specific outcomes linked to implementation. These were organized by health systems building blocks to show how each block may be strengthened through QI processes. Our initial programme theory draws from empowerment theory and emphasizes the self-reinforcing nature of QI: the more it is implemented, the more improvements result, further empowering people to use it. We identified that opportunities that support skill- and confidence-strengthening are essential to optimizing QI, and thus, to maximizing health systems strengthening through QI. Realist evaluation can be used to generate rich implementation data for QI, showcasing how it can be supported in &lsquo;real-world&rsquo; conditions for health systems strengthening</p>"

Factors associated with improvement included: (i) star rating in 2015; (ii) facility type (e.g. hospital) and ownership (e.g. public); (iii) participation in, or eligibility for, a results-based financing programme; (iv) local population density; and (v) distance from a major road. Overall, 20% of the variance in facility improvement was associated with district administration. Geographical clustering indicated that improvement at a facility was also associated with improvements at nearby facilities. Conclusion Although the majority of facilities improved their star rating, there were substantial variations between facilities. Both district administration and proximity to high-performing facilities influenced improvements. Quality improvement interventions should take advantage of factors operating above the facility level, such as peer learning and peer pressure.</p>"

Policy processes leading to universal ART were open to pressures and influence. The extraordinary financial support which enabled the widespread and rapid implementation of universal ART skewed the power balance and sometimes left little space for locally-derived solutions to respond to specific health system abilities and epidemiological contexts. Donors may be more effective if they ensure a greater focus on strengthening the whole health system as well as accounting for local contextual factors and recent policy development histories when funding policy implementation</p>"

This study examines the impact of a payment-for-performance (P4P) scheme on bypassing practices among expectant women in Tanzania. We expect the P4P intervention to reduce incidences of bypassing by improving the quality of services in local health facilities, thereby reducing the incentive to migrate. We used a difference-in-difference regression model to assess the impact of P4P on bypassing after one year and after three years. In addition, we implemented a machine learning approach to identify factors that predict bypassing. Overall, 38% of women bypassed their local health service provider to deliver in another facility. Our analysis shows that the P4P scheme significantly reduced bypassing. On average, P4P reduced bypassing in the study area by 17% (8 percentage points) over three years. We also identified two main predictors of bypassing - facility type and the distance to the closest hospital. Women are more likely to bypass if their local facility is a dispensary instead of a hospital or a health center. Women are less likely to bypass if they live close to a hospital.#</p>"

Methods: In a prospective cross-sectional survey, we analyzed the diagnostic test validity of the semiquantitative colorimetric indicator-dye-based Combur9-Test&reg; and the albumin-specific immunochromatographic assay Micral-Test&reg; for the detection of albuminuria, the distribution of the semiquantitative measurements within the albuminuria stages according to KDIGO, and the utility for albuminuria screening compared with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a walk-in population. Results: In 970 subjects, albuminuria (&ge;30 mg/g) was detected in 12.7% (95% CI 85.6&ndash;96.3%) with the ACR. Sensitivity was 82.9% (95% CI 75.1&ndash;89.1%) and 91.9% (95% CI 88.7&ndash;96.9%) and specificity 71.5% (95% CI 68.4&ndash;74.6%) and 17.5% (95% CI 15.0&ndash;20.2%) for the Combur9-Test&reg; and Micral-Test&reg;, respectively. Correct classification to KDIGO albuminuria stages A2/A3 with the Combur9-Test&reg; was 15.4%, 51.4%, and 87.9% at cut-offs of 30, 100, and &ge;300 mg/dL, and with the Micral-Test&reg; it was 1.8%, 10.5%, and 53.6% at cut-offs of 2, 5, and 10 mg/dL, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, disagreement to KDIGO albuminuria was seen in 27% and 73% with the Combur9-Test&reg; and Micral-Test&reg;, respectively. From the total population, 62.5% and 15.3% were correctly ruled out and 2.2% and 1% were missed as false-negatives by the Combur9-Test&reg; and Micral-Test&reg;, respectively. Conclusion: Compared to the Combur9-Test&reg;, the utility of the Micral-Test&reg; is limited, because the fraction of correctly ruled out patients is small and a large proportion with a positive Micral-Test&reg; require a subsequent ACR conformation test.#</p>"

Infection with helminths and intestinal protozoa cause considerable morbidity. The aim of this study was to assess the health status of schoolchildren in nine villages of the Kilombero district in Tanzania. We conducted a cross-sectional survey and subjected 427 children aged 6-12 years to standardized diagnostic tests. We found that 15% of children were infected with&nbsp;<em>Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar/Entamoeba moshkovskii,</em>&nbsp;12% with&nbsp;<em>Schistosoma mansoni</em>, and 5% with&nbsp;<em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common soil-transmitted helminth species was&nbsp;<em>Trichuris trichiura</em>&nbsp;(7%).&nbsp;<em>Strongyloides stercoralis, Schistosoma haematobium, Giardia intestinalis</em>&nbsp;and lymphatic filariasis were rare. Having a latrine inside the house was associated with a lower odds of parasite infections (odds ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27-0.96, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.04).

Despite the availability of effective control measures, 59,000 people die of rabies every year worldwide. In Tanzania, children are most at risk, contributing ~40% of deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mass dog vaccination can break the transmission cycle, but reaching the recommended 70% coverage is challenging where vaccination depends on willingness to vaccinate dogs. Awareness campaigns in communities often target children, but do not consider other key individuals in the prevention chain. Understanding factors related to dog ownership and household-level responsibility for dog vaccination and child health is critical to the design of vaccination strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We investigated who makes household decisions about dogs and on health care for children in rural Tanzania. In the Kilosa district, in-depth interviews with 10 key informants were conducted to inform analysis of data from a household survey of 799 households and a survey on Knowledge Attitudes and Practices of 417 households. The in-depth interviews were analysed using framework analysis. Descriptive analysis showed responsibilities for household decisions on dogs&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s health. Multivariate analysis determined factors associated with the probability of dogs being owned and the number of dogs owned, as well as factors associated with the responsibility for child health. Dog ownership varied considerably between villages and even households.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of dogs per household was associated with the size of a household and the presence of livestock. Children are not directly involved in the decision to vaccinate a dog, which is largely made by the father, while responsibility for seeking health care if a child is bitten lies with the mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These novel results are relevant for the design and implementation of rabies interventions. Specifically, awareness campaigns should focus on decision-makers in households to improve rabies prevention practices and on the understanding of processes critical to the control of zoonoses more broadly.#</p>"
